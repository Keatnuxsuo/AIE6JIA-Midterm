If you prefer, see Synastry Interpretations instead.)\\n\\nWhat is synastry? Synastry is the art and science of comparing two birth charts to ascertain the energy flow between two individuals. Synastry is the astrology of relationships, and it reveals the level of compatibility between two people. Please don\\'t confuse this with fortune-telling. Synastry will not tell you if you are \"fated to be together.\" Any two people can choose to be together. Synastry shows if two unique individuals can be themselves and blend nicely together, or if being themselves causes the irritating grinding of mismatched gears.\\n\\nSpecifically, 3 things are compared:\\n\\nElements – At the very least, the dominant element in each chart must flow smoothly with the other.\\n\\nHouse Overlays – \"How you perceive each other.\" This is literally laying one birth chart over the other one, aligning them by zodiac sign degrees. First we note in which of your 12 Houses your partner\\'s planets fall. Then we note in which of your partner\\'s 12 Houses your planets fall.\\n\\nSynastry Aspects (also called Inter-aspects) – These are aspects formed from planets and angles in one chart to the planets and angles in the second chart. Here is the \"nitty gritty\" of a relationship. The dynamics between you is revealed by synastry aspects.\\n\\nNothing so profoundly affects our lives as contact with others, so this subject should be entered into with compassion and a commitment to thoroughness. If you rush the process of synastry, you will make erroneous judgments about something so serious. It is too easy and common for people to compare just 1 or 2 synastry aspects and assume they have the entire relationship mapped out. This is usually a huge mistake. Do not bother with synastry if you will not take the time to consider all parts. A real relationship is always at stake.\\n\\nThe scientific part of synastry is that all aspects, house cusps, planets, points, and angles are calculated mathematically. In this sense, synastry (and all astrology) is mathematically precise. Allowable orbs for synastry aspects range according to the preference of the astrologer. Keep in mind, we exist in a universal energy field in which an energy influence increases as it comes near us or decreases as it departs. It doesn’t just appear or disappear. So we must be flexible with allowable orbs.\\n\\nThen the art of synastry is to paint a picture of this energy field that is erected between the two birth charts. Please don\\'t attempt to do this without some intermediate astrological knowledge. Especially regarding your own relationships! 99% of the time, you will not be objective regarding your own relationship synastry unless you are experienced in astrology. Take time and learn as much as you can before making judgment calls regarding relationships.\\n\\nRelated\\n\\nSynastry Interpretations\\n\\nLove & Relationship Articles\\n\\nCite This Page\\n\\nMLA style\\n\\nCorinne Lane. \"Synastry Art and Science- Synastry Aspects, Element Compatibility, House Overlays\" Astrolibrary.

The Rising sign is interchangeably called the Ascendant. It can be located on a natal chart as the sign on which the 1st House cusp falls. It is the sign that was at the eastern horizon point, from the viewpoint of your birth coordinates, at the moment of your birth. It rises on the path of the sun’s rise, and it changes degrees every few minutes. This is why an accurate birth time and place is so important for an accurate horoscope. A Rising sign can be different for twins born just a couple minutes apart. Further, this Ascendant point is the premises for the calculations of the rest of the house cusps. A few minutes of time difference shifts the entire chart.\\n\\nAstrology rising stars and sun, Classic Astrology Art\\n\\nThe Rising sign is like a direct connection between our Earth and the zodiac path. It is the zodiac sign that was “rising” over the Earth at the moment that we took our first breath, the point of intersection between the wheel of personal Houses and the celestial zodiac wheel. It represents our appearance in the world. The Rising sign is the image we project, the impression we make on others, the way we take action in the world, and the lasting effect we have on the environment. The Rising sign is often described as a public mask that we wear, since it tends to be how people see us, especially strangers who don’t know our deeper selves. But in fact, the Rising sign is not like a mask because wearing a mask denotes some level of falsity or hiding oneself. Your Rising Sign characteristics are not a \"fake cover-up\" as a mask would imply. Those characteristics are a real and true part of who your are, more like a face than a mask. Even though your face is shallow and external, you\\'re stuck with it and cannot take it off! It\\'s a real part of you, not fake. And people usually perceive it in ways that you yourself do not. That\\'s a Rising Sign for you – others see you as the embodiment of those characteristics, even though you might not see yourself like that.\\n\\nYour Sun sign is your true self, but it’s like the frame of a car, which is not so visible underneath the doors, bumpers and shiny paint. The Rising sign is how people perceive us because it is the style that we use to go about meeting the needs of our Sun sign. For example, a Capricorn-Sun person is ambitious, reserved, and needs order. But coupled with a Sagittarius-Rising sign, the person will appear care-free and un-ambitious, while all the time working hard to reach its Capricornian goals.\\n\\nWe tend to behave more like our Rising sign when we are surrounded by strangers, or in new situations, like job interviews. But still, it tends to be our personal style at all times. Personal style does not represent our deepest needs, though (like the Moon). A study of the Rising sign is best used as a tool to understand why people behave the way they do. The Rising sign is also said to describe our physical characteristics – our looks. For example, Libra-Rising is beautiful, Pisces-Rising has a dreamy appearance and small feet, Taurus-Rising is stocky with a thick neck, and so forth. We find this to be somewhat accurate most of the time. You try it and see.\\n\\nThe Rising sign is extremely important in the natal chart. The planet that rules the Rising sign is considered to be the chart ruler (planetary rulerships will be discussed in a later lesson). In practical terms, this means that every planet and sign in your natal chart is filtered through the Rising sign, or filtered through its ruling planet. Here is the most literal reason why we see people of the same Sun sign who behave so differently. They must obviously have different Rising signs.\\n\\nIn addition, people with the same Rising sign can also have different personalities because of the following: since the Rising sign is not as as basically fundamental as our Sun sign, it is greatly subject to the modifying influence of aspects. In other words, you don\\'t have a clear description of your Rising sign until you\\'ve blended in the energies of any planets aspecting the Ascendant. Example: A person with Leo Rising, but with Saturn in conjunction with the Ascendant will not be as bubbly and expressive as a typical \"Leo Rising\" person.\\n\\nSome astrologers believe that the Rising sign is the way the world forces you to behave. At some point in your youth, you were forced or taught to behave like your Rising sign. You can trace the Rising sign to one of your parents or primary care givers. Many times, the Rising sign of child will match the dominant sign of one of the parents.\\n\\nNow that you know what a rising sign is, see the Rising Sign Interpretations.\\n\\nFind out your rising sign with our Rising Sign Calculator\\n\\nCite This Page\\n\\nMLA style\\n\\nCorinne Lane. \"What is a Rising Sign/Ascendant – Astrology Lesson 6\" Astrolibrary.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/How to Read Your Own Birth Chart – Astrology Lesson 10.html'}, page_content='Astrolibrary logo\\n\\nAstroLibrary 🔎\\n\\nDaily Personalized Horoscope ↗\\n\\nHow to Read Your Own Birth Chart – Astrology Lesson 10\\n\\nastrologer observing, reading the sky through a telescope\\n\\n(This is a comprehensive lesson. If you prefer, see instead 4 Easy Birth Chart Reading Techniques For Beginners.)\\n\\n(Get your free birth chart and report here.)\\n\\nThe most important thing to remember while interpreting any birth chart is: synthesis. The entire chart must be taken as a whole. A natal chart abounds with bits and pieces of information about an individual. Each separate bit must be synthesized into one whole picture of the person.\\n\\nThis means that you cannot take one piece of the chart (for example, Mercury in Sagittarius) and decide that it defines the entire person. If you do that, you will, undoubtedly, be in error. Of course, you will be tempted to stop at one or another of the planetary meanings, and think that it is the defining factor of a person. This is a big mistake. For example, say that two individuals both have Mercury in Sagittarius (denoting something of a \"big mouth\"). You may be tempted to assume that both of the individuals are \"outspoken.\" But, say the first person has the Sun in Capricorn, while the second person has the Sun in Sagittarius. While they both have Mercury in Sagittarius, the first person (Sun in Capricorn) will have a much more reserved communication style than the second person (Sun in Sagittarius).\\n\\nThe point, again (and this point will be repeated often), is that the entire chart must be blended together. Yes, by all means, go ahead and see all the separate interpretations of each planet in its sign and house. But then you must weave it all together, and lace it with the Rising Sign, to get an accurate picture.\\n\\nIt’s as if each of us is a mosaic, made up of tiny individual images. In the birth chart, each separate planet in a sign and house is like one tiny individual image, one tiny part of the whole mosaic. Now, two different completed mosaics, if you look close enough, may contain tiny pieces that are exactly the same, yet they are part of two completely different finished mosaics (this point is illustrated by the example of Mercury in Sagittarius above). Although the mosaics contain similar pieces, the final products look nothing alike. So what we’re saying here is the opposite of that age-old adage: \"Don\\'t judge a book by its cover.\" The opposite is \"Don’t judge a book by a single page inside.\" The work of the astrologer, then, is to take all the bits and pieces of insight in the birth chart and synthesize them into a whole. What emerges is an amazingly accurate portrait of an individual.\\n\\nInterpreting Planets in the Signs\\n\\nLook at the birth chart and take note of what sign and house each planet is in. (Check here if you need help remembering what the symbols/glyphs mean.) Here is a handy, printable worksheet that will help you keep track of your birth chart information. Also take note of the Ascendant\\'s sign (Rising Sign), and which house the Ascendant\\'s ruler occupies.\\n\\nNow you can look up the \"Chart Interpretations\" of each of your planets and Rising Sign. The Chart Interpretations on the linked page are only general meanings of what each item represents. As you get a feel for the basic energy of each planet, and of the qualities of each sign, you can add your own insight.\\n\\nThe zodiac sign will show how the planet is manifested. Previously, we likened the signs to \"stained-glass windows\" through which the planet is expressed. See if this analogy helps: envision a sentence, with a \"verb\" and an \"adverb.\" The planet is the \"verb\" while the zodiac sign is the \"adverb.\" For example, the Moon (feel, nurture, respond) in the sign of Capricorn (reservedly, coldly) denotes someone who nurtures in a cold and reserved way, or has trouble expressing emotions. That\\'s not a happy placement for the Moon, but remember: there\\'s more to the story…the rest of the chart. (See what each planet means in Lesson 5: The Planets. See what each zodiac sign means in Lesson 8: Zodiac Signs)\\n\\nIncorporating the Astrological Houses\\n\\nThe other thing to remember is that the planet in the sign will focus on the House. This means that the activity denoted by the planet will take place in the arena of your life designated by the House in which that planet falls. (Remember, each House represents a sphere of life – i.e. work, home, friendships, etc.) The planet is the \"what,\" the sign is \"how\" that \"what\" is done, and the House is \"where\" it takes place. Here is a handy reminder to use when interpreting your natal chart:\\n\\nPlanets = What? Signs = How? Houses = Where?\\n\\nThe following table explains it further.\\n\\nPlanets = “What” = energies; what you like to do Signs = “How” = the way you do it Houses = “Where” = areas of your life\\n\\nAn example of why taking the House into consideration is so important:\\n\\nSay a person has Saturn in Capricorn in the 7th House, which could manifest as a reserved (Capricorn) attitude in love relationships (7th House). Then, say this same individual has Venus in Sagittarius in the 11th House. This person will be friendly and outgoing (Sagittarius) in social situations and groups (11th House), but unemotional and detached (although dependable) in love relationships (Saturn in Capricorn in the 7th). (Astrology is a powerful tool for understanding those seemingly contradicting tendencies that we all have. The birth chart tells it all. With time and patience, you will be able to read all such details from a birth chart)\\n\\nHouse Rulers (Signs on the Cusps)\\n\\nAnother influence on each House (in each department of life) is the ruling planet of the House. The ruling planet of each House in your natal chart is the planet that rules the sign on the cusp. For example, if you have Capricorn on the 7th House cusp, then Saturn is the Ruler of your 7th House, because Saturn rules Capricorn. The result is that Saturn will have an influence in the matters of your 7th House, regardless of which House Saturn is actually residing in. (Here is a table of the Sign Rulerships). The sign on each house cusp shows one\\'s attitude towards the matters of that house, whereas planets in the house show actual circumstances. For example, Capricorn on the 7th House cusp denotes an attitude of reserve or caution towards forming partnerships. On the other hand, Saturn in the 7th house may denote actual problems transpiring in partnerships and in marriage. These are subtle differences that will perfect your interpretations when reading a birth chart.\\n\\nSo a House is influenced by any planets residing in that House, but also by the ruler of the House. Most of the time, the ruler will be in a different House. Many times, the goods of the House will be used for advantage in the House where the planetary ruler actually resides. For example, say you have Capricorn on the 7th House cusp, and Saturn (Capricorn\\'s ruler) in the 2nd House. You may very well choose to marry (7th House) for money (ruler in 2nd House). This last statement brings us to our next point – a word of caution.\\n\\nA Word of Caution\\n\\nThe celestial configuration that took place at your moment of birth is a powerful indicator of your motivations, drives, preferences, and psychological makeup, but it does not seal your fate. It does show the potential you were born with, but what you do with that potential is up to you.\\n\\nSome astrologers mistakenly interpret birth charts by declaring the outcomes of the drives, or the external circumstances. They declare things that must definitively take place. But the correct way to interpret a birth chart is to declare the drives, strengths, weaknesses, preferences, needs, tendencies, and so forth. Astrology reveals our inner psychological makeup. The outcomes are for the individual to manifest for him/herself. For example, above it was mentioned that if you have Capricorn ruling your 7th House, and Saturn in the 2nd House, then you might marry for money. But the proper way to read that example is to declare that you \"have a need for security in your relationships. You have a need for security, but it does not necessarily mean that you will marry for money. You may very well choose to marry a pauper for true love. But be assured that your need for material security in relationships (as shown in your birth chart) will continue as a nagging feeling you won\\'t easily be rid of.\"\\n\\nThe natal chart never lies. The problem is when the natal chart is read incorrectly. Remember, instead of giving predestined predictions, you will be more precise to explain the potential. People choose what to do with their potential. As Henley wrote,\\n\\nI am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul.\"\\n\\nThe natal chart is one\\'s map.\\n\\nHere is another example, taken from history. Ancient astrologers, before psychology was popular, interpreted charts in a more fatalistic manner. If you were a Pisces, they would say that you would end up living in poverty (the \"starving artist\" stereotype) because you were such a \"weakling\". Modern astrologers understand the deeper psychological drives and needs that are represented by the planets and signs. Nowadays, we understand that Pisces has a need to transcend the mundane, and while he is very artistic, he is not fated to live in poverty. Pisces simply does not prioritize money or materials. He could be poor, or he could be rich. Either way, the Pisces will prioritize the intangible over the tangible – which is how we interpret it today. The interpretation shifted from a predetermined fate (poverty), to a psychological drive (need for artistic/spiritual transcendence) that may result in any circumstantial fate.\\n\\nRemembering Aspects\\n\\nDon\\'t forget the aspects. If you attempt to make an interpretation without considering the aspects, you will be in error. Interpretations for each planet in sign and house must be modified according to the nature of the aspects. Aspects can soften things and bring ease to otherwise troublesome planetary placements, or they can bring conflict to otherwise pleasant planetary placements. Aspects stimulate the planets.\\n\\nEvery planet has both easy and difficult (or positive and negative) manifestations. For example, the sun\\'s energy can be expressed as a generous pouring forth of self and creativity, or prideful arrogance and an excessive desire to be special. Aspects from other planets tell whether the energies will be expressed easily and positively (if it receives trines & sextiles), or with struggle and conflict (if it receives squares or oppositions). Again, a birth chart interpretation without accounting for aspects is incorrect, or at least incomplete. (See Lesson 9: Aspects in Astrology)\\n\\nMost important aspects to look for:\\n\\nTake immediate notice of conjunctions to any of the four angles (this means conjunctions to the Ascendant, M.C., Descendant, I.C.). When a planet makes a conjunction to one of the angles, the influence of that planet may be the strongest influence in the chart. The person will identify very strongly with the traits of that planet. This is explained in detail in: The Meaning of a Planet in Conjunction To 1 of Your Angles.\\n\\nAlso take notice of conjunctions made by the outer planets (Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto) to the inner planets (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, and Mars). These conjunctions will drastically alter the interpretation for the inner planet by adding its own qualities. A conjunction from Uranus adds rebelliousness and innovation; a conjunction from Neptune adds confusion or sadness and/or inspiration and magic, and a conjunction from Pluto adds power, but can be a bit creepy.\\n\\nFor example, a Leo-Sun person who has Pluto making a conjunction aspect with their Sun will be very Plutonian. This person would be one of the most silent and secretive Leos ever.\\n\\nBalance of Elements and Qualities\\n\\nAnother thing to note is the balance of elements and qualities in the chart. If you feel overwhelmed with all this new information, then you should simply try this step first. This is the easiest interpretation that can be derived from a natal chart, even for inexperienced people. This is how it\\'s done:\\n\\nNote the element of the sign of each planet, and that of the ascendant, and of the midheaven. This printable worksheet will help you. Then simply count how many are fire, air, Earth, and water. Count the Sun\\'s and the Moon\\'s element for 2 each, because they are such a strong influence. It\\'s common to have a combination of elements, say 3 or 4 of each. However, should you find an imbalance, such as 5 or more of an element, or 0 to 1 of an element, this will say something about the overall temperament of the individual. Five or more of one element will make that the \"Predominant Element\" in the individual. It is interesting to note that the Predominant Element may be different from that of the Sun sign. In this case, the person will behave even less like their Sun sign – yet another reason why we cannot define a person simply by their Sun sign. If a chart is completely lacking in an element, or if there is only 1 planet in an element, that will be considered the \"Weakest Element.\" The \"General Interpretations\" on the following page will include interpretations for Predominant and Weakest Elements.\\n\\nThe same method is used to tally up the balance of qualities (Cardinal, Fixed, Mutable) of each planet, ascendant, and midheaven. This gives only subtle information, unless you find a great imbalance, such as a complete lack of one quality, or 6 or more of one quality. This printable worksheet will help you.\\n\\nIf you have your worksheet filled in with all the signs and houses of your planets, continue to Chart Interpretations to help you interpret your own birth chart.\\n\\nCite This Page\\n\\nMLA style\\n\\nCorinne Lane. \"How to Read Your Own Birth Chart – Astrology Lesson 10\" Astrolibrary.

This introduction explains why relationship astrology is reliable for finding genuine happiness in love.\\n\\nFor starters, we each have different preferences and different needs. Mainstream relationship advice, whether it comes from psychologists, books, or other media, is extremely limited in its capacity to be effective simply because they all ignore that one precious fact: each human is unique, with different preferences and different needs.\\n\\nThere is not one universal definition of a good relationship or lover. Ladies, it’s a waste of time to try and fit the mold of the popular media’s definition of a great girlfriend because that definition may not attract the man that satisfies you. Men, it’s a waste of time to follow rigid dating tips that may not appeal to the woman of your dreams.\\n\\nSo how do know what attracts or appeals to the lover of your dreams? More importantly, what attracts or appeals to you? What type of man/woman is the lover of your dreams? What do you need in a lover, in a relationship, in a spouse? You may think you know the answer to these questions. However, popular media may be influencing you to seek qualities that are not your natural preferences.\\n\\nThat ultimately results in failed relationships.\\n\\nOn the other hand, relationship astrology reveals your legitimate preferences. It is surprisingly thorough at detailing all the little things that we love and hate in relationships. Astrology is an extremely effective tool for illuminating each individual’s preferences and needs, including your hidden subconscious desires. Astrology reveals your psychological makeup and your hidden drives.\\n\\nYou can test this out by reading the description of your own Venus sign: Venus in the Signs. (Note that the description of your Venus sign will be an incomplete picture of your love style because a complete description must include aspects and other astrological factors.)\\n\\nThe benefit of astrology is that it reveals your unique and true love styles, love needs, and love preferences.\\n\\nWhy is this important?\\n\\nWhen you awaken your deeply-embedded love style, you awaken the love energy that can attract a naturally compatible lover. Relationships between naturally compatible people invite happiness and genuine satisfaction into our lives.\\n\\nSagittarius Couple Holding Hands on Swing Set\\n\\nRelated\\n\\nSynastry Interpretations\\n\\nLove & Relationship Articles\\n\\nCite This Page\\n\\nMLA style\\n\\nCorinne Lane. \"Relationship Astrology – Introduction\" Astrolibrary.

You can instead go to zodiac sign descriptions. Or, for just the dates of the zodiac signs, see below.)\\n\\nWhat are the zodiac signs? The ancient Babylonians created the zodiac wheel by first splitting our sky into four sections designated by the yearly equinoxes and solstices (the turning points of the four yearly seasons).\\n\\nEach of these four sections of sky were split into 3 sections measuring 30 degrees each. This gives us a full 360-degree zodiac circle with 12 equal sections of 30 degrees each. Each 30-degree section is one zodiac sign, for a total of 12 zodiac signs (12, not 13). These 12 zodiac signs are not star constellations. The zodiac signs are 30-degree sections of space that were mathematically calculated in a way that was, and still is, intimately connected to our yearly seasons. (A Short History of Astrology)\\n\\nThe zodiac circle always assigns zero degrees of Aries (Aries, the zodiac sign, not the star constellation) to the Vernal Equinox (the Spring Equinox, or the first day of Spring in the northern hemisphere).\\n\\nThis zodiac wheel, also known as the tropical zodiac or western zodiac, is still accurate because we always align/begin it, as the ancients Greeks did, with the first day of Spring. This not a mistake. The zodiac wheel is intimately aligned with our Earth’s seasons. (This is an important fact to recognize. Some people today fail to recognize this fact, and so they erroneously claim that the zodiac wheel is misaligned. They do not understand that the Earth’s axial precession, or “precession of the equinoxes” does not impair the zodiac wheel.)\\n\\nThe ancient Babylonians used the constellations that appeared in the general area of each zodiac sign as placeholders. They designated 12 constellations to represent the 12 zodiac signs in the sky. The star constellations, with their varying degrees and sizes, are not the actual zodiac signs. These constellations were named after the zodiac signs they represent, not the other way around!\\n\\nZodiac signs wheel with sun in center. Ancient astrology art.\\n\\nThere were no cute animals or mythical creatures associated with them yet. Different energies were observed to correlate with the position of the planets in different sections of the heavens. These 12 signs became 12 different archetypes, each with their own characteristics.\\n\\n(Notice how the 12 archetypes recur in history: 12 Gods of Olympus, 12 sons of Abraham, 12 tribes of Israel, 12 Apostles of Jesus Christ, 12 Successors to the Prophet Muhammad).\\n\\nThe 12 archetypes, or zodiac signs, already had their traits before the ancient Greeks attached the popular symbols to them. The Greeks had the uncanny brilliance of choosing symbols that parallel the sign traits very closely. So now, when we think of the sign of Aries, we think of a ram; when we think of Sagittarius, we think of an archer, and so on. This lesson will not delve into the mythological stories behind the choice of symbols for the signs. We will give a topical, general description of the archetype of each sign.\\n\\nTo clarify, the following descriptions of the zodiac signs refer to the archetype of the sign itself, regardless of which planet is in the sign. We will describe the zodiac sign as if it were a person, with characteristics. In other words, the following descriptions do not specifically or exclusively apply to people with the Sun in that sign. This is because the Sun sign is not the only defining characteristic of a person. While the Sun sign is important, it is by no means the complete story of our personal profile.\\n\\nlight shining through stained glass window\\n\\nOur Moon sign, Rising sign, Mercury sign, Venus sign, and all the rest are just as important in giving us a complete picture of ourselves. We all have the entire zodiac in our charts – all 12 zodiac signs. For this reason, it is important to learn the traits of all the signs. Planets in the signs will be expressed according to the traits of the sign they are in. Thus, the zodiac signs modify the planets. Each zodiac sign is like a stained-glass window through which the planets must pass to manifest in our lives. Each \"window\" is different. And different planets through the same \"window\" will also be different. (For example, the Sun in Aries is not the same as the Moon in Aries).\\n\\nClick on each zodiac sign constellation to learn about it.\\n\\nAries Taurus Gemini Cancer\\n\\nLeo Virgo Libra Scorpio\\n\\nSagittarius Capricorn Aquarius Pisces\\n\\n* Sun Sign Dates\\n\\nNote: Being born on the cusp does not mean you have two sun signs.\\n\\nHere are the approximate dates for Zodiac Sun Signs:\\n\\nAries:\\n\\nMarch 20 – April 22 approximately\\n\\nTaurus:\\n\\nApril 19 – May 22 approximately\\n\\nGemini:\\n\\nMay 20 – June 22 approximately\\n\\nCancer:\\n\\nJune 20 – July 22 approximately\\n\\nLeo:\\n\\nJuly 21 – August 22 approximately\\n\\nVirgo:\\n\\nAugust 21 – September 22 approximately\\n\\nLibra:\\n\\nSeptember 21 – October 22 approximately\\n\\nScorpio:\\n\\nOctober 21 – November 22 approximately\\n\\nSagittarius:\\n\\nNovember 21 – December 22 approximately\\n\\nCapricorn:\\n\\nDecember 20 – January 22 approximately\\n\\nAquarius:\\n\\nJanuary 19 – February 20 approximately\\n\\nPisces:\\n\\nFebruary 17 – March 21 approximately\\n\\nCite This Page\\n\\nMLA style\\n\\nCorinne Lane. \"Zodiac Signs – Astrology Lesson 8\" Astrolibrary.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/Before Determining Compatibility – Individual Capacity to Relate.html'}, page_content='Astrolibrary logo\\n\\nAstroLibrary 🔎\\n\\nDaily Personalized Horoscope ↗\\n\\nBefore Determining Compatibility – Individual Capacity to Relate\\n\\n(This is a compatibility lesson. If you prefer, see zodiac compatibility instead, or the synastry interpretations.)\\n\\nBefore attempting to determine compatibility between 2 people, check each birth chart separately to determine what each individual’s capacity to relate is? How well matched are their needs for intimacy? How well do the individual life goals, styles, and rhythms blend? If their life goals don’t match up well, all the compatibility in the world will not help such star-crossed lovers.\\n\\nAnswer the 4 following questions:\\n\\nHow comfortable is each with their biologic role and how well do these roles match up? How well does each relate to their own and the opposite sex? Those at ease with the opposite sex will be frustrated when trying to form a relationship with someone who is not. Do not assume that others function the same as you do, as that will plant the seeds of friction and annoyance when you find that they do not. Look at the aspects of the Sun, Moon, Venus and Mars in the birth chart. Then check your aspects in the following 3 tables to see what those aspects signify.\\n\\nDo you Play Well with Males?\\n\\nLook at Sun\\'s Aspects\\n\\nif Sun has several good aspects; no squares or oppositions of Sun\\n\\nGenerally at ease & comfortable with males, and comfortable playing society\\'s expected role towards males\\n\\nif Sun is unaspected, or only lightly aspected\\n\\nMales will not play a significant role in one\\'s life\\n\\nif Sun has hard aspects (squares or oppositions)\\n\\nRelating to males (whether father, friend, or lover) is stressful & anxious; has difficulty accepting society\\'s demands in relating to males\\n\\ncompatibility with males, father, son, grandfather\\n\\nrelationship compatibility with females\\n\\nDo you Play Well with Females?\\n\\nLook at Moon\\'s Aspects\\n\\nif Moon makes harmonious aspects – conjunctions, trines and sextiles\\n\\nRelates easily and happily to females\\n\\nif Moon makes no, or minimal, aspects\\n\\nInteraction with females is generally unimportant, routine, or obligatory\\n\\nif Moon makes hard aspects\\n\\nFinds female qualities irritating or demanding (either in themselves or others)\\n\\nCan you be Happy in Love and Sex?\\n\\nif Venus has good aspects; no squares or oppositions\\n\\nHappy capacity to give of self, find beauty & value in others, and act to communicate those feelings\\n\\nif Venus has hard aspects\\n\\nLimited ability to express love; limited ability to develop trust & admiration for another person enough for a love commitment\\n\\nif Mars is well-aspected\\n\\nCommunicates sexual needs openly & gracefully\\n\\nif Mars is badly-aspected\\n\\nstressful or discordant sexual style\\n\\nHow well do the life goals, limitations, and unconscious needs of each match up? Where do they find satisfaction, fulfillment, limitations, frustrations, and illusions? If these are not well matched, no amount of love, sexual attraction, worldly success or effort will prevail against a simple mismatch of what each person defines as a good and satisfactory life. Look at the Houses in the birth chart containing the Moon, Venus, Saturn, and Neptune…\\n\\nWhat is \"The Good Life\" to you?\\n\\nLook at Houses of Moon & Venus\\n\\nThe Houses containing the Moon and Venus show what areas of life provide you with a sense of emotional fulfillment and joy of living (especially the Moon\\'s house). If these houses clash with those of your partner, conflict down the line will be inevitable regardless of how compatible your personalities are. A person\\'s life goals are almost always (I dare say, always) related to one of these houses. These houses signify those things you want to do when you retire, or when you win the lottery. Would you prefer to go sky-diving or snuggle up with a book? Travel the world, or be a cookie-baking grandparent?\\n\\nSome brief examples: A person with Moon in the 5th house may get a sense of well-being from the pursuit of pleasure and thrill-seeking adventures. Moon or Venus in the 4th house prefers to sit at home. Moon or Venus in the 7th house needs to be in a one-to-one relationship, but in the 11th house large community groups are preferred. Moon or Venus in the 12th is comfortable in solitude and may forego partnerships altogether. 10th or 6th house: needs to be productive instead of relaxing and thrill seeking; likely a workaholic. But in the 10th house, public worldly success is a must, while in the 6th enjoyment comes simply from a job well-done, working behind the scenes.\\n\\nExamine the Houses containing the Moon and Venus in both charts to see if the individuals can possibly enjoy life together.\\n\\nSee descriptions of all 12 Houses See interpretations for Moon in the Houses See interpretations for Venus in the Houses\\n\\nWhere are you Frustrated or Limited?\\n\\nLook at House of Saturn\\n\\nThe House containing Saturn is the most frustrating area of life for the individual. There exists ambivalence regarding this house: you want the stuff of this house, yet at the same time, you don\\'t want it. There seems to be built-in limitations in this area of life. What is frustrating for the individual will eventually carry over into any relationship. Couples beware of your partner\\'s house of Saturn! Limitations can be overcome, but not without struggle, as this house is sure to teach. Can you accept your partner’s Saturn? More about Saturn in the Houses.\\n\\nWhere are you Disappointed? Fall for Illusions?\\n\\nLook at House of Neptune\\n\\nThe House containing Neptune is the area of life that is always just out of reach. This is the sphere of life that will seemingly forever elude us in finding completeness. Yet, in this house, we endlessly chase illusions and fulfillments. We have big dreams for this house, but only limited success. Couples beware of your expectations regarding your partner\\'s Neptune house! No doubt, this is the most inspired and inspiring house in the birth chart, the only one where fantasy can become real, but here…what you see is not always what you get. Dreams can come true in your Neptune house (Oprah has Neptune in her House of Career), but more often than not, Neptune leaves us swimming in a deep pool of delusion and fantasy. Can you swim in your partner’s Neptune house? Better yet, have you got room in your boat? More about Neptune in the Houses.\\n\\nWhat’s your Love Language?\\n\\nWhat type of relating energy exists in each chart? Sexual energy? Emotional energy? Companionability? Permanence? These can be seen as relating \"languages.\" Understanding the partner\\'s love language can help avoid feelings of rejection. For example, if one partner naturally pours much emotionally and/or physically into the relationship, but the other is, by nature, much less emotionally or sexually energetic, this can be misinterpreted as disinterest or lack of commitment to the relationship. We really only understand love in our own \"love language.\" If your partner speaks fire and you speak water, you will both feel like you don\\'t love each other. Loving someone in that scenario will require a lot of work. And unfortunately, you will not easily appreciate the effort because it will usually be in a language foreign to your heart.\\n\\nA different way of understanding these energy levels is to see them like radio frequencies. Fire, air, water, and earth are different radio frequencies, or radio stations. If you are a water person, then you are tuned into the water station. You will not pick up love vibes coming from the fire or air station. They may be breaking their head trying to prove love to you, but you will not be receiving it because you are tuned in to the water station.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, water and earth signs are compatible with each other. Air and fire signs are compatible with each other.\\n\\nKnowing a person\\'s love language ahead of time can help one avoid a bad choice of partner, or avoid resentment about the partner\\'s way of relating.\\n\\nLook at the element of your Venus sign. Your Venus element is your love language; read below to see how each element understands “love”.\\n\\n(If you want to be super-specific…Look at the elements of the signs of the following: Moon, Venus, Mars, and Cusps of 5th house, 7th house, & 8th house. These planets and house cusps have to do specifically with how we relate to others. Calculate the strongest element within these planets and house cusps. Give the element of Venus\\'s sign an extra point. If you get a tie between two elements, go with the element of your Venus sign.)\\n\\nWhat\\'s your Love Language?\\n\\nLook at your Venus Element\\n\\nWater signs bring the most emotional energy (read: intimate, soul-level bonding) to partnerships. Water needs an emotional, soul-merging to feel love. Water Venus loves deeply and shows it by caring about your well-being and your feelings. Touching and talking alone will not satisfy this Venus; they need to \"feel\" love from you in order to be satisfied in love.\\n\\nFire signs bring the most physical energy (read: sexual energy). Fire Venus needs to be active together to feel love; fun outings, adventurous vacations, etc. And tons of sex. Fire Venus people can seem self-centered because when in love, they feel it coming from inside them, rather than being based on the other person. The other person may be in front of them saying, \"hello, look at me,\" but Fire Venus ignores because they are too busy being consumed with love. They love passionately.\\n\\nEarth signs bring stability and durability (read: a keeper) to partnerships, but have a more limited emotional range. Earthy Venus people need your physical presence near them, but don\\'t get mushy because they won\\'t have it. Emotional expressions should be limited to what you want for dinner, or which movie you want to see. They handle physical and material needs, not emotional ones. Earthy Venus is faithful. In bed, you will appreciate their mastery of the physical. They are sensual.\\n\\nAir signs bring great companionability and intellectual stimulus to partnership but perhaps the least of all emotional energy and physical responsiveness (read: excellent communication, interesting conversations, but of a detached acquaintance-type). Air Venus needs companionship, someone to talk to, someone to hang out with, someone to watch movies with. (But most of all, someone to talk to.) These are friendly people, and even in love, the relationship may seem more like a friendship. This may sound nice, but if you need deep emotional bonding, you will not find it here. If you need a lot of physical presence (as in Earth Venus) forget about Air Venus. Like the wind, they come and go as they please.\\n\\nCompare the 4 love languages more by reading these articles:\\n\\nFire Sign Love Language\\n\\nWater Sign Love Language\\n\\nAir Sign Love Language\\n\\nEarth Sign Love Language\\n\\nWhere are the individuals in their great life cycles and how well do their life agendas fit together? What is the current focus of life? Trying to settle down with a partner who does not have a relationship on their agenda at the time ends up in the notorious situation of a lingering love affair that never progresses to the next step.\\n\\nSaturn is the \"time-clock\" or \"taskmaster\" of our lives. We tend to reassess, rewrite, and focus on the portion of our lives indicated by the house that Saturn is transiting at any given time. Knowing this ahead of time helps to distinguish between genuine and durable compatibility and just a temporary coincidence of meshing desires. A person is highly unlikely to begin or endure in a real relationship if Saturn is not transiting through a \"relationship house.\" (Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto transits can direct our focus, as well, but Saturn is more solidly felt).\\n\\nLook to the house that Saturn, the great time-clock of our lives, is transiting. We are most open to partnerships when Saturn (or Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto) transits through the following Houses:\\n\\nIs it Your Time for a Relationship?\\n\\nOnly if Saturn is Transiting 1 of the following houses in your birthchart\\n\\n4th: Home & Family\\n\\n5th: Pleasure, Romance, Children\\n\\n7th: Marriage\\n\\n8th: Partner\\'s Finances, Psychological issues, Sex\\n\\n10th: Partnering for the purpose of establishing identity or public recognition\\n\\nIn Summary\\n\\nThe 4 questions above describe the broad boundaries of each individual\\'s capacity to relate. These boundaries create the stage on which any relationship must take place, and limits which cannot be crossed. Then, the smaller frame of personal compatibility must be determined only as it fits within these broad boundaries since these ultimately define the outer ranges of any relationship. Compatibility is discussed on the next page.\\n\\nRelated\\n\\nSynastry Interpretations\\n\\nLove & Relationship Articles\\n\\nCite This Page\\n\\nMLA style\\n\\nCorinne Lane. \"Before Determining Compatibility – Individual Capacity to Relate\" Astrolibrary.

If you prefer, see Synastry Interpretations instead.)\\n\\nFire and air are compatible with each other, and they are the yang elements. Earth and water are compatible with each other, and they are the yin elements.\\n\\nIn general, we can see eye to eye with people of our compatible elements. It’s best to start with compatible Sun-sign elements (both yin or both yang). This is really the ideal. Some astrologers say there are so-called compensations for incompatible Sun elements that can make for a bearable relationship. But we tend to disagree. Yang (fire & air) and Yin (earth & water) just don’t see eye to eye. This isn’t necessarily bad, but you will spend a great deal of time explaining yourself to each other. If you are dominant yang energy, you will notice that you need to put in extra effort to understand a yin person, and vice versa. Communication will not be smooth in such a relationship.\\n\\nBeing in a long-term relationship with the wrong energy can actually be detrimental to your health. It’s doable, but not always healthy.\\n\\nThe ideal is compatible Sun elements. If the Suns are compatible, everything else can be worked on. And this is not a asking too much — about half of the population is compatible with your Sun element. You can check which Sun signs are compatible with your own on the Zodiac Signs Compatibility page.\\n\\nIn addition, compatible Moon elements, Rising sign elements, and Venus sign elements are desirable. The more the better. Compatibility is all about this elemental energy flowing smoothly. Incompatible elements are like gears of a transmission grinding against each other instead of flowing smoothly. You can actually test this and get a feel for incompatible energies: take a 4-hour car drive with a person who has an incompatible Moon element.\\n\\nThe four elements express and understand love differently.

This is not to say that the planets (or the signs) cause anything to happen. What we observe is synchrony – that things are taking place in sync. One movement is flowing throughout our space, heavens, and Earth. Instead of causing, the planets indicate things, describing what is already taking place. But for the sake of convenience, astrologers use phrases like, “your Venus makes you like this,” or “his Mars made him act like that.” Please note that this is only for convenience in communicating. Astrologers know that the planets don’t force us to do anything, any more than your 5:00pm clock forces you to stop working. But you do stop working when the clock strikes 5:00pm, don’t you? And so you pay careful attention to that clock, because that clock will show you when it’s time to go home from work. But the clock never forced you to leave work, neither did it ever seal your fate. In the end, you decide when to leave work. That is the beauty of synchronicity.\\n\\nAs has been mentioned, the Sun and the Moon are included when we say “the planets.” Astrologers do this for convenience. The ten planets of astrology are: Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto[1]. (From our geocentric position, Earth is not included in the list; however Earth\\'s interplay in the scheme of things is denoted by the Ascendant.) However, before the 18th century only the first seven planets were recognized (they were perceivable to the naked eye): Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Since over 2,000 years ago, the seven classical planets were observed to keep time, orbiting steadily on their paths. Perhaps that is why the number seven was symbolic of deity in ancient cultures. The seven were named after Greek gods because their influence was considered to be as such. Seven was the number of days chosen for a week, with each day borrowing its name from one of the classical planets. (The days making up our calendar month were determined based on one complete cycle through the 12 zodiac signs by the moon, from which the word \"month\" comes from.)\\n\\nThe discoveries of Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto corresponded to revolutionary changes in our world, from the Industrial Revolution and discovery of electricity (Uranus), to the financial collapse and interest in world domination of the 1930’s (Pluto). Pluto’s demotion of status to a “dwarf planet” does not change the fact that it is a celestial body participating in the continuous flow of energy in our world. Thus, Pluto is included here as a planet. (Astrology also observes several other asteroids/planetoids, regardless of planetary status. The body is there, thus, it counts.)\\n\\nEach planet symbolizes a different component of life, a different type of energy. In psychological terms, we can call them “needs” or “drives.” Click on the astrology planets above to learn what each one brings to astrology.\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n1.

The Sun represents your will, and its sign determines the dynamic expression of the will, which is carried out through the activity of the other planets in the horoscope. Remember, the sun sign is just the start of your portrait. Think of your horoscope as a painting of you. The characteristics of your Sun sign are the first broad strokes that the artist first lays down on the canvas. The artist outlines your general shape, the planes and angles of your face, the way in which you hold your body. In the same way, your sun sign delineates your fundamental character, your core. Are you introspective? Do you make friends easily? Are you pompous or plain, generous or greedy? How do you cope with responsibility? Are you high-strung or easygoing? The answers may be found in a study of your Sun\\'s position by sign and house, and any aspects from it.\\n\\nInterpretations for the Sun in each zodiac sign are available here: Sun in the Signs\\n\\nInterpretations for the Sun in each House of the birth chart: Sun in Houses\\n\\nReturn to Top Return to Leo\\n\\nfull moon planet\\n\\nThe Moon\\n\\n“I feel”\\n\\nBest quality: Adaptability Worst quality: Inconstancy\\n\\nThe Moon is as important as the Sun in your natal chart. The Sun sign is a part of you that is apparent to others; it is what others see. The Moon sign is the part of you that you see. The Moon represents your emotional nature and instinctive reactions – emotional responses based on past experiences and unconscious habit patterns that you have developed. It comprises all the little surface peculiarities, moods, and changes that have to do with physical life which are disturbing, fleeting, and changing. It describes the way you behave in instances in which you haven’t had time to think things through, your immediate emotional responses. Have you ever done something that you immediately regretted and thought, “that’s not like me.” It may have been your Moon sign qualities at work. The sign that the Moon is in shows what makes you feel emotionally nurtured, secure, and satisfied. Because emotions run so deep, the Moon sign represents your greatest need. It also shows how you nurture others. Most of the time, your Moon sign will only be apparent to those who live with you, or people that are very close to you. In many ways, your Moon personality is the one you keep hidden. It is your inner core, which feels hate, jealousy, fear, and has fantasies that you often deny even to yourself. On the other hand, it is your Moon personality that spontaneously feels and expresses joy and pleasure. It is the part of you that enjoys the little sensualities of life. The Moon in your horoscope modifies your Sun sign; it brings new forces, different motivations, and spiritual elements to the character of your Sun sign. For example, a Gemini-Sun person with Moon in Taurus will be more dependable than a Gemini-Sun with Moon in Aquarius. Here is another reason why we cannot define a person simply by their Sun sign.\\n\\nThe Moon is also a symbol of fertility and femininity; its sign colors one\\'s relationship with the mother, and with women in general. In a male\\'s chart, it indicates the type of woman he feels most comfortable with. Although the Venus sign indicates a male\\'s romantic/erotic preference in partners, the Moon sign indicates the type of woman he would choose as a lifelong mate (because the Moon \"needs\" are stronger than the Venus \"wants\").\\n\\nThe Moon is constantly waxing and waning, from new Moon to full Moon and back. The house position of the Moon in your natal chart shows the area of life where you tend to be the most emotional, and where you often experience changing conditions. The house of the Moon also gives clues to the type of activity that occurs on the domestic scene.\\n\\nInterpretations for the Moon in each zodiac sign are available here: Moon in the Signs\\n\\nInterpretations for the Moon in each House of the birth chart: Moon in Houses\\n\\nReturn to Top Return to Cancer\\n\\nmercury planet astrology\\n\\nMercury\\n\\n“I think”\\n\\nBest quality: Expression Worst quality: Restlessness\\n\\nMercury is the planet of intelligence and communication. It governs our rational and intellectual faculties, perception and reason, memory, speaking, and writing. Mercury reflects your capacity to collect, sort, and communicate the knowledge you gain through your experiences and your senses. It reflects the way you see, hear, understand, and assimilate information. Mercury is symbolic of that child-like curiosity that drives your urge to know, and the ability to analyze and reason. Mercury also has to do with transportation and short trips, and the nervous system. The positive manifestations of Mercury include clever speech, eloquence, persuasiveness, success with public speaking and a sharp, quick mind. The more negative manifestations include restlessness, a tendency to be critical, sarcastic, argumentative and sly. The quick wit of Mercury can quickly turn into trickery. Lies, deceit, fraud, swindling, and forgery are examples of Mercury’s negative power. The sign of Mercury in your natal chart shows your style and preferences of communicating and learning. A strong Mercury in one\\'s chart, free of any negative aspects, indicates a brilliant mind.\\n\\nInterpretations for Mercury in each zodiac sign are available here: Mercury in the Signs\\n\\nInterpretations for Mercury in each House of the birth chart: Mercury in Houses\\n\\nReturn to Top Return to Gemini Return to Virgo\\n\\nvenus astrology planet real image\\n\\nVenus\\n\\n“I love”\\n\\nBest quality: Affection Worst quality: Pliancy (bending too easily, taking the easy way out)\\n\\nVenus is the planet of love, pleasure, and beauty. It represents your capacity to express affection and to enjoy beauty. This includes your capacity to attract and appreciate the things of the world, whether they are emotional, physical/material, mental, or spiritual things. It defines the type of people you draw to yourself, based on your social values. Things ruled by Venus include: what kind of sex appeal you posses, love affairs, the arts, beauty and beautiful things, adornment, affection, the social graces, harmony, and friendship. Being the planet of pleasure, it points to the kinds of amusements you are drawn to and in what ways you spend your money. The position of Venus in your natal chart can answer such questions as: What kind of lovers do you attract? Are you flirtatious? Do you find happiness in your love affairs, or are you often disappointed? Where do your creative talents lie? The sign of Venus gives important information about how you expresses yourself in personal relationships, especially in love and marriage. It also indicates your attitude toward money, personal possessions, creature comforts, and social and aesthetic values. Your Venus sign also reveals your idea of the \"perfect woman.\" In a male\\'s chart, the Venus sign indicates the type of woman that attracts him. In a woman\\'s chart, the Venus sign indicates the qualities that she uses to attract lovers. The house position of Venus indicates the type of people with whom you establish relationships, both friendships and romances, and where you are most likely to find an artistic outlet.\\n\\nVenus never travels far from the Sun. In your horoscope, it is always either in your Sun sign or in one of the two signs immediately preceding or following your Sun sign. A well-aspected Venus bestows charm, diplomacy, and tact. Some negative manifestations of Venus are self-indulgence, jealousy, envy, lust, and of course, unfaithfulness.\\n\\nInterpretations for Venus in each zodiac sign are available here: Venus in the Signs\\n\\nInterpretations for Venus in each House of the birth chart: Venus in Houses\\n\\nReturn to Top Return to Taurus Return to Libra\\n\\nastrology planet mars real image\\n\\nMars\\n\\n“I act”\\n\\nBest quality: Initiative Worst quality: Harshness\\n\\nMars is the exact opposite of Venus. Whereas Venus represents the female, Mars is all male. Whereas Venus is about harmony, Mars is conflict, aggression, and outright war. Mars is the planet of physical energy. It governs your sex drive, your forcefulness and your aggression. It is associated with your desires and aspirations for emotional, physical, mental and spiritual things that stimulate activity. You have to want something before you reach out and take it; Mars is the heated passion behind action. Mars shows your ability to turn ideas into action. The sign of Mars in your natal chart indicates your vitality, energy level, and style of action. In a female\\'s chart, the Mars sign is one factor suggesting the type of man she attracts. In its highest form, Mars represent your unleashed energy and your human will – initiative. A controlled Mars can give a healthy dose of assertiveness and ambition. At its worst, Mars energy makes one prone to anger, harshness and destructive violence, impulsive behavior, danger, combativeness and every kind of cruelty. It’s up to you to use this force constructively.\\n\\nInterpretations for Mars in each zodiac sign are available here: Mars in the Signs.\\n\\nInterpretations for Mars in each House of the birth chart: Mars in Houses\\n\\nReturn to Top Return to Aries\\n\\njupiter astrology planet\\n\\nJupiter\\n\\n“I grow”\\n\\nBest quality: Benevolence (kindness) Worst quality: Conceit\\n\\nJupiter is the planet of good luck, optimism, success and generosity. Jupiter brings joy to life. Think expansiveness and abundance, as Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system. Jupiter signifies knowledge, higher leaning, breadth of vision, confidence, charity and good-will, frankness and honesty. Jupiter’s knowledge is on a philosophical level (as opposed to Mercury’s day-to-day cleverness). It is the broad view of the higher mind. Psychologically, Jupiter is the search for meaning or truth. As such, it represents law and justice, philosophy, religion, metaphysics, and education. Jupiter encompasses the urge for self-improvement through participation in the larger whole. It urges you to go forth exploring life. Jupiter\\'s sign indicates what you idealize, what your ethical, religious, and philosophical standards are. The sign also indicates where you express expansiveness, where you do things on a large scale. Jupiter in your chart shows where you are likely to receive financial and material benefits, and in turn, where you express generosity to others. The House of Jupiter is where we tend to be optimistic, and the affairs of that House usually flow easily. Jupiter’s qualities include benevolence (kindness), wisdom, morality, and spirituality. If negatively placed in the chart, Jupiter’s energy can be manifested as self-righteousness, excessiveness, squandering, exaggeration, over-indulgence, superficiality, and bigotry. However, even when negatively positioned, Jupiter is protective and beneficial. Over-indulgence and excess often lead to learning the lesson of restraint. Even with a negatively-aspected Jupiter, a person will tend to \"land on their feet\" when problems arise in the areas signified by Jupiter\\'s House.\\n\\nInterpretations for Jupiter in each zodiac sign are available here: Jupiter in the Signs\\n\\nInterpretations for Jupiter in each House of the birth chart: Jupiter in Houses\\n\\nReturn to Top Return to Sagittarius\\n\\nastrology planet saturn with ring\\n\\nSaturn\\n\\n“I achieve”\\n\\nBest quality: System and Organization Worst quality: Selfishness\\n\\nAstrologers of the past regarded Saturn as \"evil\" and malignant, indicating dire misfortune and misery wherever it was found in a chart. When Venus wishes for love, Saturn denies her. When Jupiter promises good fortune, Saturn delays it. When Mercury brings news, Saturn degrades it, and when Mars goes too hard or too fast, Saturn will crash him. But this is not necessarily bad. Saturn is associated with the principles of limitation, restrictions, boundaries, safety, practicality, reality, seriousness, and structures. Saturn is the laws, boundaries and limits set by society or karma. Modern astrologers acknowledge that the hardships brought on by Saturn\\'s limitations, compel one to continue striving for a final product, that although delayed, will be solid and of real worth.\\n\\nSaturn governs ambition, career, authority, hierarchy, and conforming social structures. It concerns a person\\'s sense of duty, discipline and responsibility, and their physical and emotional endurance during hardships. Saturn is morose and cold, melancholic, and serious. By placement in your chart, it indicates the area of life in which you may feel shame, for a time. This is the area where you have lessons to learn. But this is where your disciplined hard work will lead to genuinely earned, long-lasting success. At its best, Saturn endows organization and order. At its worst, Saturn’s energy is manifested as selfishness. The sign of Saturn also gives clues to the kind of work for which a person is suited and the kind of career he is likely to pursue.\\n\\nInterpretations for Saturn in each zodiac sign are available here: Saturn in the Signs\\n\\nInterpretations for Saturn in each House of the birth chart: Saturn in Houses\\n\\nReturn to Top Return to Capricorn\\n\\nastrology planet uranus on its side with ring\\n\\nUranus\\n\\n“I evolve”\\n\\nBest quality: Originality Worst quality: Rebellion\\n\\nUranus represents the unconscious urge to become aware of your true inner individuality (the Sun). Like a lightning bolt, Uranus symbolizes sudden flashes of insight, moments of revelation, and spurts of creativity. Uranus’s energy is usually described as suddenness, revolution, change, shock, and disruption. Like lightning, Uranus breaks into time and fractures our patterns. New ideas break into ordinary streams of thought, bringing innovative solutions to stubborn problems. It is your intuition awakening you to a world beyond our social structure. Uranus forces sudden changes when the usefulness of the old is gone and something newer, something higher and better is ready to take its place. Uranus encompasses technology and all types of electronic devices. Uranus speeds up the mind, making it to bypass logic and arrive at conclusions by leaping from A to Z, shocking people. Uranus seeks alternatives to the common and accepted forms. True to itself, the planet Uranus stands out from the rest of the planets by orbiting around on its \"side.\" The rest of the planets orbit like a \"spinning top,\" but Uranus insists on rolling on its side like a ball. At best, Uranus encourages originality, versatility and independence. At worst, it encourages eccentricity, perversion and rebellion. Uranus demands freedom.\\n\\nInterpretations for Uranus in each zodiac sign are available here: Uranus in the Signs\\n\\nInterpretations for Uranus in each House of the birth chart: Uranus in Houses\\n\\nReturn to Top Return to Aquarius\\n\\nneptune astrology planet\\n\\nNeptune\\n\\n“I dream”\\n\\nBest quality: Idealism Worst quality: Vagueness\\n\\nNeptune represents the unconscious urge to dissolve the boundaries of your ego-centeredness in order to ‘lose yourself’ in other realms of being. While Uranus breaks into our dimension to allow momentary flashes of insight into other realms of existence, Neptune is those other realms. Neptune dissolves life’s patterns in order to teach new meanings in the quest for universal wisdom. Neptune represents things that aren’t quite as they appear, the illusive, and the unreal. It is the planet of receptivity, imagination, cloudiness, confusion, delusion, illusion, and unreality. Neptune is also associated with movies, acting, and compassion. Neptune can indicate mystical visions of a divine creator, or an experience of the primordial chaos before creation (dangerously, the latter can drive one to madness). Neptune can indicate spiritual healing and service to others, or becoming lost in a foggy world of fantasy and dreams. More often than not, Neptune indicates confusion in the House where it resides in your birth chart. A negatively positioned Neptune in the natal chart can indicate a tendency to escape reality. The house and sign will indicate whether it be through mind-altering drugs and alcohol, day-dreaming, sexual addiction, cult worship, psychosis, potential suicide, or others. At its best, Neptune\\'s energy inspires marvelous art, music, theatre, dance, poetry, and film. Above all, Neptune represents the intangible, and makes it very real.\\n\\nInterpretations for Neptune in each zodiac sign are available here: Neptune in the Signs\\n\\nInterpretations for Neptune in each House of the birth chart: Neptune in Houses\\n\\nReturn to Top Return to Pisces\\n\\nastrology planet pluto\\n\\nPluto\\n\\n“I empower”\\n\\nBest quality: Transformation Worst quality: Inversion (turning things upside down)\\n\\n(See Why Pluto is still valid even though it’s not a planet anymore)\\n\\nPluto represents the unconscious urge to transform repressed ego-desire energies into group-desire energies in order to live out your role in society’s evolution. Pluto represents sexuality (the act itself, as opposed to the energetic desire which is associated with Mars), obsessive desires, transformation, power, and the ingredients of great wealth (investments, banking, loans, debt, mortgages). Pluto has dominion over drastic changes that bring true upheavals. Since Pluto is the slowest-moving planet, an entire generation will share the same Pluto sign, giving it historical importance. Drastic and permanent changes in civilization as a whole can be linked to Pluto\\'s movement through the signs. On a personal level, the House that Pluto occupies in your chart will show how Plutonian energy is manifested in your life. Pluto will transform those things in your life that require regeneration, whether you desire it or not. You may experience dramatic crises or have to endure terrible suffering where Pluto is involved in your chart, but for the purpose of healing. Pluto tears down only to transform and regenerate what has been destroyed. Pluto is associated with recklessness, mental obsession and compulsion, emotional resistance, and overall transcendence. It is also associated with unsolved mysteries, secrets, and taboos.\\n\\nInterpretations for Pluto in each zodiac sign are available here: Pluto in the Signs\\n\\nInterpretations for Pluto in each House of the birth chart: Pluto in Houses\\n\\nReturn to Top Return to Scorpio\\n\\nCite This Page\\n\\nMLA style\\n\\nCorinne Lane. \"Planets in Astrology – Lesson 5\" Astrolibrary.

These three classifications essentially define the zodiac signs. Just by knowing the element, quality, and polarity, you would be able to describe the fundamental traits of each zodiac sign without actually learning the sign. This is a very important lesson, indeed.\\n\\nThe author considers this the single most important lesson of the zodiac. The elements, qualities, and polarities are the fundamental, underlying nature of each zodiac sign. Learn these!\\n\\nElements | Qualities | Polarities\\n\\nZodiac Elements\\n\\nThe element of a zodiac sign reveals the basic temperament of the sign. The element of your Sun, Moon, or Rising sign are of significant importance, but the overall distribution of elements in your chart is what counts the most. Having more than 4 planets in an element will have an impact on your behavior, even if that element does not correspond to your Sun sign. An abundance (5 or more), or a lack (0-2), of an element has much impact on your temperament. See Balance of Elements.\\n\\nThere are four zodiac elements, with three zodiac signs belonging to each element group. The elements are interchangeably called \"triplicities;\" this is because there are three (triple) signs per element. The four elements are Fire, Earth, Air, and Water.\\n\\nFire Zodiac Element\\n\\nThe fire signs are Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius. Fire signs respond to energy very quickly. They favor action. They\\'re ready to go, take a risk, start a business, go on a trip, etc. They are confident, idealistic, intense, and approach life with zest and enthusiasm. Here is energy to conquer, lead, and travel physically and mentally. Aries must act, Leo must lead grandly, and Sagittarius explores unknown places and ideas.\\n\\nPositive keywords: extroverted, energetic, enthusiastic, inspirational, visionary, high-spirited, simple and direct, physically active, dramatic, courageous, warm.\\n\\nNegative keywords: overly active to the point of burnout, restless, impatient, selfish, insensitive, willful, hasty, lacking in perspective, thoughtless, impulsive, reckless, extravagant, wild.\\n\\nSee the love style of the fire signs.\\n\\nEarth Zodiac Element\\n\\nThe Earth signs are Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn. Earth signs are more cautious in their approach. They are more practical, realistic, and they need solid footing before going forward. Taurus will dig the heels in and really ponder things. Virgo will analyze. Capricorn will climb, but will do it with care, first needing a vision, a plan, an organized structure before starting the ascent. Earth signs are dependable, thorough and solid.\\n\\nEarth signs seek to engage the physical world and master it through efficient organization. Earth signs seek economic security, respect, and prestige, and they work hard for it.\\n\\nPositive keywords: practical, efficient, organized, realistic, patient, self-disciplined, hard-working, productive, enduring, persistent, dependable, stable, good common sense.\\n\\nNegative keywords: slow, stodgy, lacking in vision, unimaginative, petty, excessively conventional, narrow-minded, stubborn, resistant to change, hoarding, ultra conservative.\\n\\nSee the love style of the earth signs.\\n\\nAir Zodiac Element\\n\\nThe Air signs are Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius. Air signs approach energy mentally; they are thinkers. They are social, always ready for a new relationship or friendship. They love learning, but bore easily. Gemini has great intellectual curiosity, but too many personalities. Libra is partnership driven, but not in an emotional way. Aquarius is popular with friends and is unstoppable when it has a cause to champion. Air signs are into ideas and people. They are communicative; they must share information, interact with others, and influence society.\\n\\nPositive keywords: articulate, objective, mentally clear, detached, capable of forethought, understanding, socially adept and adaptable, cooperative, relational.\\n\\nNegative keywords: unemotional, lacking in sympathy, impractical, disassociated from the body and the physical world, over-adaptive, abstracted, glib and facile, hyperactive.\\n\\nSee the love style of the air signs.\\n\\nWater Zodiac Element\\n\\nWater signs respond to energy almost unconsciously. They are deeply emotional. Cancer is motivated to nurture and be nurtured. Scorpio has intense vision, never swaying, looking straight ahead with laser-like focus. Pisces is the trickiest to describe. Pisces energy is chameleon-like, absorbing its surroundings.\\n\\nPositive keywords: deeply emotional, sympathetic, empathetic, nurturing, calm and peaceful, sensitive, compassionate, imaginative, intuitive, psychically aware.\\n\\nNegative keywords: emotionally insecure and unstable, shy, timid, lacking in confidence, oversensitive, easily influenced and manipulated, withdrawn, uncommunicative, vindictive and vengeful, takes everything personally, moody and depressed.\\n\\nSee the love style of the water signs.\\n\\nZodiac Qualities\\n\\nThe qualities, also called \"modes,\" or “modalities,” indicate how people respond to stimuli, and especially how they act under tension. They indicate how the signs express their element, meaning the mode of behavior they use to express the element needs. There are three qualities: Cardinal, Fixed, and Mutable. They are also called \"quadruplicities\" because there are 4 signs per group. To learn how to calculate the balance of qualities in a birth chart, see Balance of Qualities.\\n\\nInterestingly, there’s one sign from each element in each group of qualities. So, in the Cardinal Signs group, there’s one fire sign, one earth sign, one air sign, and one water sign.\\n\\nCardinal Signs\\n\\nAries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn\\n\\nCardinal Signs are the most assertive, the most interested in initiating change. Their mode of activity is to start new things. They easily begin things and respond well to new ideas. They are self-starters. Crisis motivates them. They achieve control by remaining one step ahead of everyone else. Aries seeks leadership and control in general, Cancer controls emotions, home, and family; Libra tries to control partnerships; Capricorn controls, uses, and exploits the material environment. For Cardinal signs, things are always happening. This is usually because they are doing the starting. The four Cardinal signs are at the first month of each season.\\n\\nFixed Signs\\n\\nTaurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius\\n\\nFixed Signs are the most stable and self-contained. Their mode of activity is sort of passive, yet determined, unwavering, and even stubborn. Their strength is their consistency and loyalty. They follow things through to the end, managing and sustaining what has been started by the Cardinal signs. They may go to denial in times of change. They are very resistant to change, needing to take time to prep themselves. They tend to be late: Taurus is just slow; Scorpio uses tardiness as a subtle power struggle; Leo enjoys making an entrance; Aquarius wants things on their own terms. Late, but once there, they stay forever. The four Fixed signs are at the middle month of each season.\\n\\nMutable Signs\\n\\nGemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces\\n\\nMutable Signs are the most unstable and most open to influence by the environment. Their mode of activity is to make the transition from the old to the new, opening the way for the Cardinal Signs to begin a new cycle. They are infinitely flexible and tolerant. They find it naturally easy to let go. Whereas Cardinal signs begin new things, and Fixed signs sustain things, Mutable energy loosens structures and adapts it to new and changing conditions. With this territory comes mental worry. Mutable signs have many things going on in their heads rather than in tangible form. Many react by making lists. Some suffer from negative mental tension, involving fear, paranoia, and panic attacks. In anticipating negative outcomes, they really suffer during the worry process. But their high adaptability always sees them through. Gemini is changeable in its ideas; Virgo is dominated by its environment; Sagittarius has a continually changing view of life\\'s possibilities; Pisces adapts itself superficially to its environment (like a chameleon) and reflects it like a mirror. Sometimes they compromise so much that they sacrifice their own interests. The four Mutable signs are at the final month of each season.\\n\\nBetween elements, qualities, and signs, there is only one combination of each, making each zodiac sign unique. For example, there is only 1 cardinal fire sign, only 1 cardinal earth sign, only 1 cardinal air sign, etc. You can understand the nature of each sign by examining these energetic combinations. See the table below (or open in Print/Download View).\\n\\nFire Earth Air Water Cardinal Aries Capricorn Libra Cancer Fixed Leo Taurus Aquarius Scorpio Mutable Sagittarius Virgo Gemini Pisces\\n\\nZodiac Polarities\\n\\nThe two polarities are sometimes referred to as male/female, positive/negative, or yang/yin. Modern astrologers prefer to call the polarities active/receptive. This type of duality is the earliest form of classification. Six of the zodiac signs are yang energy, which is also known as “masculine” energy. The six yang signs are Aries, Leo, Sagittarius, Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius. These are the Fire and Air signs. These signs are more active and assertive rather than receptive.\\n\\nThe other six signs are yin energy, which is also known as “feminine” energy. The six yin signs are Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn, Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces. These are the Earth and Water signs. These signs are more receptive and reactive rather than active.\\n\\nIn general, signs of the same polarity can understand each other\\'s personalities, whereas signs from opposing polarities have a difficult time seeing eye to eye. Air feeds Fire and empowers it; Earth needs Water for life. When talking about compatibility, Air and Fire signs (yang) go with each other, while Earth and Water signs (yin) go with each other.\\n\\nHere are keywords to help describe the two opposing yin/yang energies.\\n\\nYang Yin direct outgoing extroverted giving active male (traditionally) positive (traditionally) indirect passive/reactive introverted withdrawn receiving/receptive reactive female (traditionally) negative (traditionally)\\n\\nSummary\\n\\n(Open the following table in Print/Download View.)\\n\\nSign Element Quality Polarity Aries Fire Cardinal Yang (+) Taurus Earth Fixed Yin (-) Gemini Air Mutable Yang(+) Cancer Water Cardinal Yin (-) Leo Fire Fixed Yang (+) Virgo Earth Mutable Yin (-) Libra Air Cardinal Yang (+) Scorpio Water Fixed Yin (-) Sagittarius Fire Mutable Yang (+) Capricorn Earth Cardinal Yin (-) Aquarius Air Fixed Yang (+) Pisces Water Mutable Yin (-)\\n\\nSee a printable Zodiac Wheel, labeled with all the Signs, Elements, Qualities, and Polarities.\\n\\nCite This Page\\n\\nMLA style\\n\\nCorinne Lane. \"Elements Qualities Polarities – Astrology Lesson 7\" Astrolibrary.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/Compatibility in Love Relationships _ AstroLibrary.html'}, page_content='Astrolibrary logo\\n\\nAstroLibrary 🔎\\n\\nDaily Personalized Horoscope ↗\\n\\nCompatibility in Love Relationships\\n\\n(This is a compatibility lesson. If you prefer, see Zodiac Compatibility instead.)\\n\\nIn discussing compatibility, we will overlook “initial attraction” (for now). The difference between “initial attraction” and “compatibility” is great, for the first never ensures the second, and the second can manifest without the first, as many of us are forced to find out in the course of our lives. Here we focus on compatibility, and whether it exists between two people who are already past the “initial attraction” stage of a relationship.\\n\\nCompatibility between two people is not so much a thing, as it is the absence of a thing – absence of friction. Now, compatibility is not simply the sort of harmony that takes place when we are on a romantic date. Men and women tend to be on their best behavior on a date, putting their best foot forward and performing all the charming niceties that are expected from a romantic encounter. In a way, it can be said that people on dates are performing an act. There will be an illusion of compatibility on any romantic date, even between incompatible lovers. This is not a true measure of compatibility because the people in those cases are acting a part.\\n\\nCompatibility Relationship, Compatible couple, man and woman in movie theater\\n\\nTrue compatibility can only be determined based on our natural dispositions, our real personalities, our deep-seated mannerisms and habits. It can only be determined on “the morning after,” when the charming date from the night before reveals his/her ordinary habits, peculiar quirks, eccentricities and other daily behaviors. Often, these daily idiosyncrasies are what drives couples apart or attracts genuine admiration.\\n\\nSo, compatibility is the lucky situation in which both partners can be themselves without irritating each other. If you have to alter your behavior or style so as not to annoy your partner, then compatibility is lacking. Also, if you have to grit your teeth to acquiesce to your partner’s expression of his/herself, compatibility is lacking. If simply being yourselves causes friction with each other, compatibility is lacking.\\n\\nThis is really a matter of energy flow. For example, try joining the positive ends of two magnets. They will not stick together regardless of how “attractive” or “charming” they are. Their energies repel each other. Humans are similar to magnets because we are part of a universal field consisting of an ebb and flow of energy. But unlike magnets, we humans are very complex, and we have many more points to consider than just “positive” and “negative.” Everyone has some great qualities, but not everyone is compatible with you.\\n\\nSince compatibility is really a matter of smooth energy flow between two people, not much can be done to “fix” an incompatible union. An incompatible couple is one in which the natural energy of one partner clashes with the natural energy of the other. It is unfair and sad that many divorcing and separating couples hurt each other in great proportions by bashing each other’s personalities, when the real problem may be a simple mismatch of energies (like repelling magnets).\\n\\nIncompatible couples can possibly succeed in a relationship, but it will require a lot of work and planned romantic dates. You may get along during the artificial scenarios (dates), but the incompatible partner will always rub you the wrong way just by being him/herself when you are not on a date. Their natural manner of being will irritate you. This is because your energies don’t blend well. As a result, the union creates tension, stress, and unhappiness.\\n\\nCompatible couples do not need many extras; they can simply enjoy being in each other’s presence. They can be themselves without causing friction in the relationship. This is because their energies flow together nicely. As a result, such a union creates happiness.\\n\\nOf course, no two people are perfectly compatible in every way (not that we are aware of). Compatibility, as we know it, exists in levels. Higher levels of compatibility result in happier relationships.\\n\\nAstrology, as the unique language of energy, is the most powerful tool available for determining compatibility, before risking years in a relationship. But even if you’ve been married for years, astrology can actually pinpoint the deep root of problem areas in your relationship. Astrology helps people learn how to deal with each other because it reveals the inner workings of their psyches. Even if you are stuck with an incompatible partner, astrology will get you to say, “Now I know why he/she is like that.”\\n\\nNumerous astrological techniques can (and should) be used to determine compatibility levels between two lovers. Some of these astrological techniques are simple and fun, such as comparing Venus, Mars, and Moon signs. Other techniques are far more complicated. All methods of determining compatibility fall under the magnificent and special branch of astrology: synastry.\\n\\nThe comparison of two birth charts in astrology is called synastry. The art of synastry is perhaps the most beloved branch of astrology. Synastry is discussed on the following page.\\n\\nRelated\\n\\nSynastry Interpretations\\n\\nLove & Relationship Articles\\n\\nCite This Page\\n\\nMLA style\\n\\nCorinne Lane. \"Compatibility in Love Relationships\" Astrolibrary.

They are 2 different wheels.\\n\\nThe zodiac wheel is based on the sun’s apparent yearly rotation about our Earth, along the ecliptic.\\n\\nThe wheel of Houses is based on our Earth’s 24-hour rotation about its own axis.\\n\\nThe 2 wheels join together at points derived by calculations involving your exact birth time and astronomical birth coordinates.\\n\\nThen, the planets are described in 2 ways: as being in a zodiac sign, and also as being in a House.\\n\\nFor example, two people may both have a Libra Sun sign, but one may have the Libra Sun in his 12th House, while the other may have his Libra Sun in his 1st house. This could make for two very different types of people.\\n\\n(Another reason why the popular daily Sun Sign Horoscopes are a bunch of silliness: they are written assuming everyone has their Sun in the 1st House.)\\n\\nThe 12 Houses of astrology are symbolic of the all the departments that make up human life. The planets and zodiac signs will manifest themselves most strongly in the sphere of life represented by the House in which they fall on your chart (and also in the House which they rule; more on House Rulerships below).\\n\\nRemember, the houses are not “energies” like the elements or planets, nor do they color the expression of energies like the zodiac signs do. The houses are WHERE these energies are most likely to manifest. The houses are the fields of experience, not the experience themselves.\\n\\nNotice how the order of the Houses follows the developmental path of a human’s life, from the original impulse of individual being (1st house), to learning what is “mine” and how to use what one owns (2nd house), to learning how to communicate within the limitations set by our environment (3rd house), etc. The following description of the Houses are short and topical, directed at beginners.\\n\\nThe most important houses are the 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th houses. These are called the \"angular houses\" because their cusps coincide with the 4 special angles: ascendant, I.C., descendant, and M.C.. Planets in the angular houses will influence you the most.\\n\\n1st Astrological House\\n\\nThe first House is the House of self. This includes self-awareness, the physical body, personality, appearance, personal views on life, self-identity, self-image, early environment, and beginnings; how we initiate, how we’re impulsive. Any planets in this house will greatly influence your personality and how others perceive you.\\n\\nTop\\n\\n2nd Astrological House\\n\\nThe second House refers to your own money and possessions, what you value, your hidden talents, sense of self-worth, self-esteem (how you value yourself, instead of describing your personality as in the 1st House). Possessions include anything a person owns (except the house/home which is ruled by the 4th House): cars, furniture, clothing, moveable property, investments and securities, etc. The 2nd house specifies how you gain and spend your own money (as opposed to other\\'s money in the 8th house), your attitude towards wealth and material possessions, and your potential for accumulating it/them.\\n\\nTop\\n\\n3rd Astrological House\\n\\nThe third House is that of communication, which by extension includes one\\'s immediate environment: siblings, neighbors, short journeys, and all forms of transportation. The 3rd house also includes the intellect, the lower mind (details and small bits of information as opposed to the higher mind in 9th house), thinking patterns, and early education (before college). Communication includes messages, deliveries, gossip, phone calls, visits, reading and writing.\\n\\nTop\\n\\n4th Astrological House\\n\\nThe fourth House refers to the home and everything associated with it (both the childhood home & the current home): family, land, personal foundations (inner emotional security), your roots. Astrologers are divided over whether this house is associated with one\\'s mother or father. What is clear is that a person\\'s upbringing is associated with this House.\\n\\nOn a deeper level, the 4th house is the base of consciousness or the center of our concrete existence. See how the cusp of the 4th house is the I.C., the lowest point on the chart, representative of things below the surface of Earth. Due to that, the 4th house was believed to rule the conditions at the end of life, and graves. As the root or base of your real self, the 4th house rules where you go when you \"die\" but also where you came from. For those who believe in reincarnation, the 4th house would give clues to your karmic lesson for this lifetime. It shows what karmic baggage you brought with you into this life. Even if you don\\'t believe in reincarnation, you\\'re likely to be surprised by what you find in your 4th house for it may move your soul.\\n\\nAny planets in the 4th house affect your home life, your emotions, your subconscious, and possibly your relationship with your parents.\\n\\nTop\\n\\n5th Astrological House\\n\\nThe fifth House refers to children, creativity, and the pursuit of pleasure. This includes personal interests, love affairs, sports, hobbies, speculation, risk-taking, teaching, drama, creative self-expression, love given, gambling. The 5th house is all about you being yourself and enjoying it.\\n\\nRomance, dating, love affairs, and sexual relationships are ruled by this 5th house, yet marriage is assigned to the 7th. Why? Because, until very recently, marriage was not entered into for pleasure, for love, nor for personal fulfillment. Marriage was hardly even entered into by choice, but rather for the purpose of raising kids to preserve the values of a particular culture or religion. And these marriages were most often arranged according to class and financial status, a partnership befitting the 7th house.\\n\\nNowadays, it\\'s common to marry for love. To avoid confusion, remember: affairs of the heart are in the 5th house, but cooperative partnerships are in the domain of the 7th house.\\n\\nTop\\n\\n6th Astrological House\\n\\nThe sixth House refers to daily work, service, diet, health and physical sickness, physical ability to work, employees. This includes volunteer labor, civil service work, caretaking, and mundane daily tasks. The 6th house really involves the quality of your work, the quality of the jobs you perform, as opposed to an actual career (career is represented by the 10th house). Daily mundane tasks include personal hygiene and our method of responding to everyday crises.\\n\\nTop\\n\\n7th Astrological House\\n\\nThe seventh House is sometimes referred to as the House of marriage, but it encompasses all one-to-one relationships: marriage, business partnerships, contracts, cooperative relationships, and also divorce, separation, quarrels, open enemies, and law suits.\\n\\nThe difference between the love affairs of the 5th House and love relationships of the 7th is that the 7th House refers to more permanently binding relationships, whereas the 5th House refers to affairs that may be temporary. When the 5th House affair progresses into a serious relationship, we can say that the relationship has \"moved into the 7th House.\"\\n\\n7th house relationships are about cooperation and sharing, and they generally serve some functional purpose in the larger social community (i.e. a marriage). This is different from a 5th house love affair, whose only qualification is \"butterflies in the stomach.\"\\n\\nThe 7th house includes the way you relate to those closest to you. Planets in this house will influence your manner of relating. They also give clues to issues that arise in your relationships.\\n\\nTop\\n\\n8th Astrological House\\n\\nSimply put, the 8th house is the polar opposite of the 2nd house. Whereas the 2nd rules your own individual possessions, the 8th house rules what a relationship owns (joint finances).\\n\\nThe 8th House is one of the most misunderstood Houses. This is probably because the things represented by the 8th House seem to have nothing in common with each other, or they seem to be negative. This House governs death, regeneration, taxes, inheritances, wills & legacies, sex (the actual act of sex), latent occult ability, joint resources, your partner’s money and possessions, spouse\\'s money, bankruptcy, losses, personal sacrifices, alimony, clairvoyance.\\n\\nOn a positive note, this House is about transformation and healing. But transformation and healing require some type of death, loss, or injury first. This House rules those processes and things by which we transform and become more powerful. Yes, this includes the act of sex.\\n\\nTop\\n\\n9th Astrological House\\n\\nThe ninth House refers to philosophy, religion, law, learning, higher education (as opposed to early education by the 3rd House), ethics, morals, long journeys, travel, foreign countries and interests, spiritual urges, dreams, visions, higher mind, ideas, understanding and wisdom, books, publishing, ceremonies, and rituals. This is the House of big thoughts and big ideas.\\n\\n9th house \"understanding\" is more complex than 3rd house \"knowledge\". The act of \"knowing\" belongs to the 3rd house because it implies simply the direct contact of a person with something in his environment. Understanding involves the synthesis of known data.\\n\\nWhile the 3rd house refers to an individual\\'s need to understand his close and personal environment, the 9th house is an area in which one seeks to discover the significance of larger fields of social existence which one may not experience directly but which his mind may explore through the use of analogy, generalization and abstraction. The 3rd and 9th houses symbolize the 2 polarities of the human mind, the concrete and the abstract.\\n\\nIn summary, the 9th house includes experiences that we encounter when we search for the meaning of things. Whatever expands your field of activity or the scope of your mind – long journeys, contact with other cultures, great dreams, and even experiences with fortunetellers.\\n\\nTop\\n\\n10th Astrological House\\n\\nThe tenth House is the House of status, honor, community power, prestige, reputation, and professional career. In our society, this includes financial success, but only as it relates to community power and prestige. It\\'s not about gaining \"material stuff\" as it is in the 2nd house. The 10th house wants success for the sake of honor and social status.\\n\\nThis house includes social foundations (as opposed to personal home foundations in the 4th), recognition, personal achievements, social responsibilities, sense of duty, authority figures, politicians. This House encompasses the most public areas of one\\'s life, and the career that you grow into, as opposed to daily work and odd jobs ruled by the 6th House.\\n\\nAs with the 4th House, astrologers are divided over whether the 10th House rules one\\'s mother or father. Those that say the 4th House rules the mother, say the 10th House rules the father, and vice versa. What is clear is that the 4th House rules the nurturing, home-body parent, while the 10th House rules the public, success-focused parent (the parent who \"wears the pants\").\\n\\nAs with the other angular houses, any planets in this house are very important. Planets in the 10th house, the sign on the cusp of the 10th house, and its ruling planet will greatly influence your career and your general reputation in public.\\n\\nTop\\n\\n11th Astrological House\\n\\nThe eleventh House is the House of community, large groups, and friends. It refers to memberships, hopes, goals, ambitions, wishes, social groups, associations, humanitarian interests. It also refers to self-realization, liberty, legislation and regulation.\\n\\nTop\\n\\n12th Astrological House\\n\\nThis is probably the most misunderstood house of all. The twelfth House refers to the subconscious, the hidden self that exists apart from our physical everyday reality. This includes the unconscious mind, subconscious memory, subconscious habit patterns from the past, mental illness, karmic debts, self-deception, escapism, spiritual realization, limitations, frustration, and ultimately our self-undoing.\\n\\nOn a physical, material level, the 12th house includes things that take us away from everyday life: institutions (such as hospitals, prisons, government offices), places of confinement, secrets, secret relationships, hidden enemies, and self-sacrifice for others. It also refers to sorrow, tribulations, widowhood, grief, funerals, exile, seclusion, bribery, subversion, murder, suicide, kidnapping, and endings.\\n\\nFor those who believe, the 12th house is also considered to refer to the collective unconscious of all humanity.\\n\\nTop\\n\\nastrology houses labeled chart\\n\\nastrology houses labeled chart in color\\n\\n“Natural” Houses of the Planets & Signs\\n\\nEach planet and zodiac sign is naturally associated with a House, the House that most corresponds to its archetype. The planet, then, is said to be the “Natural Ruler” of that House, or more often, it’s said to be “at home” in that House.\\n\\nThe House/planet associations were adjusted with the discoveries of Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. The following table lists the current House rulers, along with the traditional rulers. The traditional rulers are still considered to be co-rulers of that House (along with the new planet that rules the House).\\n\\nNote: in your own birth chart, the rulers of your houses are determined by the signs that fall on the cusps of your houses. However, the natural rulers, listed here, give a subtle influence.\\n\\nTable of Natural Ruling Planets of Each House\\n\\nHouse Keywords Zodiac Sign Natural Ruler Traditional Ruler 1st self, life, body Aries Mars 2nd possessions, money, material circumstances, livelihood Taurus Venus 3rd local movement, short journeys, communication, school, siblings Gemini Mercury 4th home, family, roots, parent Cancer Moon 5th creativity, children, romance, entertainment Leo Sun 6th health, service, work, routine Virgo Mercury 7th partners, marriage, open enemies Libra Venus 8th sex, death, inheritances, other’s money, loss Scorpio Pluto Mars 9th travel, higher education, religion, spirituality, law Sagittarius Jupiter 10th career, social position, dominant parent Capricorn Saturn 11th friendships, associations, aspirations Aquarius Uranus Saturn 12th hidden matters, the unconscious, clandestine relationships, secret enemies, seclusion Pisces Neptune Jupiter\\n\\nTake Note: The qualities of the zodiac signs are not exactly the same as those of the Houses which they are associated with. There are subtle differences between the qualities of the signs and Houses. More on the zodiac signs later; but first, learn about the star players, the Planets.

If you prefer, see Synastry Interpretations instead.)\\n\\nHouse Overlays say a great deal about how you see each other, what you expect out of each other, and in which areas of life you affect each other. The planets overlaid in the Houses of another person reveal how the planet person (person who’s planets are in your houses) perceives the house person (person who’s birthchart houses the other’s planets are overlayed upon). The planet person will then have expectations according to their perceptions of the house person. The planet person will act accordingly. This, in turn, evokes a response from the house person. Here begin the dynamics of the relationship. Then we flip the whole thing to see the 2nd person’s planets in the 1st person’s houses.\\n\\nHouse overlays are the secret to knowing how that special guy or girl really sees you. House overlays don’t necessarily describe how compatible you are based on your personalities. They reveal how you see each other. How we perceive each other largely determines how we treat each other, and whether or not we’ll even approach each other. Are they intimidated by you? Are they mesmerized? Are they disgusted?\\n\\nIn effect, House Overlays reveal the areas of life of the house person that will be affected by the other’s presence (planets). But it begins with the perception of the planet person. It’s similar to entering someone’s actual home. When you enter someone’s home for the first time, you immediately perceive and form expectations based on the surrounding environment. Similarly, the planet person enters a birth chart house, and perceives you according to the environment of that specific house.\\n\\nSince House Overlays reveal perceptions and expectations regarding the partner, they can be used to pinpoint problems. Many relationship problems, separations, and divorces come about because of wrong perceptions about the partner, or lofty expectations. Partners should discuss what the House Overlays reveal, as it would bring them to a common understanding about each other’s expectations.\\n\\nIn addition, House Overlays can reveal why certain relationships never get off the ground. Some house-planet overlays denote negative perceptions from the beginning.\\n\\nRelated\\n\\nSynastry Interpretations\\n\\nLove & Relationship Articles\\n\\nCite This Page\\n\\nMLA style\\n\\nCorinne Lane. \"House Overlays – Deeper into the 3 parts of Synastry\" Astrolibrary.

If you prefer, see Synastry Interpretations or calculate your synastry aspects.)\\n\\nThe aspects from one birth chart to another show how the two individuals get along. Planets making harmonious aspects mean that those dimensions represented by each planet blend together with pleasing results. Planets making inharmonious (often called challenging or dynamic) aspects produce discordant, irritating and unpleasant results.\\n\\nFor example, a man’s Moon blending harmoniously (conjunct) with a woman’s Venus will make for a tender, emotional, sweet interaction between them (if the rest of the synastric analysis concurs). On the other hand, if his Moon makes a challenging aspect (square) to her Venus, then her way of projecting herself as a woman (Venus) will emotionally (Moon) irritate him instead of arousing tenderness.\\n\\nNow, there is always a mixture of harmonious and challenging synastry aspects between two charts. Don’t expect to find perfect synastry. That probably does not exist. We are simply looking for the positive aspects to be stronger than the negative aspects. If the negative aspects are stronger than the positive, the two people will bug each other so much that the irritation will outweigh the power of attraction between them.\\n\\nRelated\\n\\nSynastry Interpretations\\n\\nLove & Relationship Articles\\n\\nCite This Page\\n\\nMLA style\\n\\nCorinne Lane. \"Synastry Aspects – Deeper into the 3 parts of Synastry\" Astrolibrary.

You should already know that aspects are relationships, measured in degrees of arc, between two planets in your birth chart. (An aspect can also take place between a planet and a special angle or point in your birth chart, i.e. Ascendant, M.C., I.C., Descendant, Lunar Nodes, and some other points.)\\n\\nTransits are, in effect, aspects between a planet’s current position up above and its position in your birth chart.\\n\\nThe positions of the planets at the moment you were born are captured on your birth chart. As you took your first breath, the planets continued on their tracks. As the planets continue moving, every once in a while, they come into aspect with the planetary positions on your birth chart.\\n\\nFor example, say you were born with the Sun at 16 ° and 28 minutes of Cancer, and Pluto at 24 ° of Libra. When Pluto moved into 16 degrees of Capricorn, in the year 2016, it made an opposition aspect (180 °) to your natal Sun.\\n\\nTo be clear, that aspect is called a “transit.” We would not call it an aspect because when we speak of aspects, we are usually speaking of natal aspects based on the positions of the planets at someone’s birth. An aspect made by a transiting planet is called a “transit” in astrology.\\n\\nA moving planet can stay in aspect anywhere from a few hours up to a few years. The moon, because she moves so fast, makes aspects only for a short hour or two. And then she’s gone. Neptune and Pluto, because they move so slowly (relative motion), can stay in aspect for 2 or 3 years. Use an orb of 1 degree to consider transits (but use a 2 degree orb to plan ahead!) While a moving planet is in aspect to a natal planetary position, the moving planet is said to be “transiting” the natal planet.\\n\\nThe transit has an influence over you during the entire time that it’s transiting, but it also has a point at which it becomes “exact.” This is the day when it reaches the exact degree, minute, and second of your birth planet. Some transits can become exact three times because of retrograde motion: the transiting planet passes over the point once, then the planet goes retrograde and backtracks over the point, then the planet goes back into direct motion and passes over the point a third time.\\n\\nIn the example above, Pluto would be transiting your natal Sun throughout most of 2016 because it will be close enough to 16 ° to be considered in aspect. But that transit becomes “exact” in 2016 when Pluto reaches exactly 10 ° and 28 minutes of Capricorn.\\n\\nIn summary, transits are simply aspects made by the current moving planets to our birth-chart planets. Technically, the planets are always in transit, as in “on the move.” But in astrology, “transit” is a term of art. In the language of astrology, planets make “transits” or are “transiting” only when they make aspects to our birth chart.\\n\\nTo find out your own personal transits, try the Transits calculator.\\n\\nCite This Page\\n\\nMLA style\\n\\nCorinne Lane. \"What Are Transits In Astrology? – Lesson 18\" Astrolibrary.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/Aspects and Orbs in Astrology – Lesson 9.html'}, page_content='Astrolibrary logo\\n\\nAstroLibrary 🔎\\n\\nDaily Personalized Horoscope ↗\\n\\nAspects and Orbs in Astrology – Lesson 9\\n\\nAspects in astrology are extremely important when interpreting any chart. Aspects indicate how the various planetary and sign energies actually play out. They indicate, among other things, if there will be struggles or ease. Without acknowledging the aspects in a chart, the reading is incomplete, and ultimately incorrect. Keep this in mind when you begin to read the interpretations of your planets in the signs of your chart – the aspects tell more of the story.\\n\\nSo, what are aspects in astrology? Simply put, aspects are a connection or relationship between two or more planets. This connection always alters the interpretation of the planets and signs involved. When planets are in aspect to each other, their interpretations must be blended according to the nature of the aspect.\\n\\nTo be precise, aspects are special degrees of separation between the planets, with respect to the Earth. Since astrology focuses on the interplay between the celestial bodies and our Earth, we take a geocentric (Earth-centered) view of the heavens. The planets, then, are observed to orbit at different speeds in approximately the same plane in space.\\n\\nearth space astrology art\\n\\nAs a result of these planetary motions, various angles, measured in degrees, arc minutes, and arc seconds, are formed between the planets as seen from the Earth. In mathematics, an angle is defined as that fraction of a circle formed between two lines that intersect at the vertex. Imagine the Earth being at the center of the circle. Then imagine a line being drawn from two planets each to the Earth, so that the Earth is the vertex of the angle. The number of degrees between the two lines connecting two planets with respect to the Earth forms the angular relationship – the aspect – between the two planets. Aspects are considered not only for the planets, Sun, and Moon, but also for the points of the Ascendant and the Midheaven.\\n\\nExample of an Aspect\\n\\nastrology chart square aspect, labeled\\n\\nIn this example image, the Sun and the Moon are in \"square\" aspect. They are 90° apart, as you can see by the angle formed by the gray lines. However, astrologers do not label aspects like that, for that would be a tangled mess of lines in the birth chart. Instead, the angular relationships are denoted by a single line connecting the two planets in aspect. Thus, in any astrology chart, the square aspect will be denoted by a line like the red one in the image above.\\n\\nCertain degrees of angularity are very important in astrology. They are called the \"major aspects.\" The major aspects are 0° (conjunction), 60° (sextile), 90° (square), 120° (trine), and 180° (opposition).\\n\\nWhat Are Orbs?\\n\\nNow, aspects are given a margin in which they have an influence. For example, although the square aspect is 90°, two planets that are 95° (or 85°) apart are still considered to be in square aspect. This margin of influence is called an \"orb\" in astrology. In the example of 95°, it is considered a square aspect with an orb of 5°, since it deviates 5° from an exact square. An allowable orb is the amount by which the two planets involved can deviate from the exact number of degrees of the aspect and still be considered to have an aspect influence. Most astrologers use an allowable orb of only 6° for the major aspects, and 2° or 3° for the minor aspects. However, the allowable orb is increased to 10° (or 8°) if it includes the Sun or Moon. This is a matter of preference, but in fact, the smaller the orb, the more significant the aspect is, with orbs of less than 1° being the most potent aspect influences.\\n\\nAs you\\'ll see below, each aspect can be defined as a circle divided by a number. A full circle is 360°. However, to avoid confusion, notice that the astrology chart is divided into 12 signs of 30° each. Then the square aspect (90°) will be between planets that are in the same degree, but three signs apart. The sextile will be two signs apart, the trine will be four signs apart, and the opposition will be six signs apart.\\n\\nMany pages can be written describing the dynamics of each aspect, but here we will brief. Keep in mind that as you grow in your knowledge of astrology, and as you gain experience in interpreting charts, you can add your own insight into how the aspects are manifested.\\n\\nMajor Aspects\\n\\nConjunction ()\\n\\ndiagram of conjunction astrology aspect, 0 degrees\\n\\nThe conjunction (0°) is the circle divided by one (in which the conjunction can be termed as 360° apart, which is the same as 0° in a circle). This is a very dynamic aspect, since it marks a strong focalized potential for expression along with a tendency for direct action and self-dramatization. The two planets in conjunction are blended together, fused, and intensified. Planets in conjunction must be interpreted as a blend in which the planets work together. This can be a good thing if the two planets get along (like say, Venus and the Moon), but it can be inharmonious if the two planets are incompatible (like say, Mars and Neptune).\\n\\nSextile (\\n\\nsextile astrology aspect, glyph symbol\\n\\nDiagram of sextile astrology aspect\\n\\nThe sextile aspect (60°) is the circle divided by six. It represents an easy flow of opportunities or ideas that, if acted upon, will help realize the individual\\'s goals. It can also indicate talents. This is a harmonious aspect in which the energies of the planets involved collaborate well and work comfortably together. However, while this is traditionally a positive aspect, it is not dynamic. This aspect is rather passive, and it does not necessarily bring an impetus to do anything. The sextile aspect can be characterized as a lack of friction. The main reason that it’s considered positive is that it will not disrupt anything. This is usually pleasant, but can sometimes go unnoticed.\\n\\nSquare ()\\n\\nThe square (90°) is the circle divided by four. This aspect implies restrictions and challenges. It is a dynamic aspect since the challenges pressure you to work on the issues represented by the planets involved. Planets in square aspect are at cross-purposes. They are in conflict that leads to irritation; achievement is delayed, though patient hard work can lead to success through integration of the two principles. Traditionally, this is a negative, inharmonious aspect. The planets and houses involved are areas in the individual\\'s life where adjustments must be made and where tremendous effort must be expended to realize gains.\\n\\nTrine ()\\n\\ndiagram of trine astrology aspect\\n\\nThe trine (120°) is the circle divided by three. This is considered the most fortunate of aspects. The trine aspect represents easy flowing energy between the planets involved, bringing luck, opportunities, and innate creative talents. But even too much of a good thing can be bad – the ease brought on by the trine can sometimes be taken for granted, and the talents left unexpressed. In the ancient days, this aspect was thought to bring about a laziness (due to all the good luck) that was considered evil. But more often than not, the trine aspect tends to manifest the most pleasant potential of the planets involved.\\n\\nOpposition ()\\n\\nThe opposition (180°) is the circle divided by two. Planets in opposition will appear directly across from each other in the birth chart. This aspect indicates a fundamental polarity or duality; a situation in which one must cooperate with others or break with them. It creates tension leading to frustration, though objectivity can lead to a delicate balancing of opposites. Resolving the tension is helped by compromising between the two energies, otherwise they bounce back and forth, competing for center stage in your life. Compromise can be achieved by accepting that the two are parts of a whole. In general, this is considered an inharmonious aspect.\\n\\nMinor Aspects\\n\\nSemi-sextile (\\n\\nsemi-sextile astrology aspect glyph symbol\\n\\nThe semi-sextile (30°) is the circle divided by 12. This aspect is very mild, barely noticeable, almost insignificant. It is considered by some astrologers as mildly beneficial, but since it connects signs of different elements and qualities, it may actually be mildly difficult, awkward, or uncomfortable. This aspect should be interpreted by taking into account the rest of the chart for more insight. This minor aspect will usually corroborate with other things specified in the chart.\\n\\nSemi-square ()\\n\\nThe semi-square (45°) is the circle divided by 8. This is similar to the square, but less intense. This aspect implies friction, generating minor internal conflict or frustration that can be annoying.\\n\\nSesqui-quadrate (\\n\\nsesqui-square astrology aspect glyph symbol\\n\\nThe sesquiquadrate (135°), also known as the sesquisquare, is 3/8 of a circle, or \"a square and a half.\" This aspect denotes the same friction as the semi-square, but this irritation tends to generate external difficulties (whereas the semi-square correlates more with inner conflict).\\n\\nQuincunx (or Inconjunct) (\\n\\nquincunx astrology aspect\\n\\nThe quincunx (150°) is 5/12 of a circle. This aspect demands continual adjustments. It is not necessarily negative, but it brings strain, some difficulty, or stress. This can sometimes affect the health. It can indicate circumstances that are forced upon the person, or self-neglect regarding that area of life.\\n\\nQuintile ()\\n\\nThe quintile (72°) is the circle divided by five. Quintiles imply artistic or creative talents, especially mental ones, as well as versatility and an authentic individuality. It is considered mildly beneficial. The biquintile (144°, ) is considered in the same way as the quintile.\\n\\nThe Cosmolabe Was Used To Measure Aspects\\n\\nPeople in history measured the aspects using a cosmolabe. The following cosmolabe was made by Jacques Besson in 1567.

If you prefer, see Synastry Interpretations instead.)\\n\\nWhat is synastry? Synastry is the art and science of comparing two birth charts to ascertain the energy flow between two individuals. Synastry is the astrology of relationships, and it reveals the level of compatibility between two people. Please don\\'t confuse this with fortune-telling. Synastry will not tell you if you are \"fated to be together.\" Any two people can choose to be together. Synastry shows if two unique individuals can be themselves and blend nicely together, or if being themselves causes the irritating grinding of mismatched gears.\\n\\nSpecifically, 3 things are compared:\\n\\nElements – At the very least, the dominant element in each chart must flow smoothly with the other.\\n\\nHouse Overlays – \"How you perceive each other.\" This is literally laying one birth chart over the other one, aligning them by zodiac sign degrees. First we note in which of your 12 Houses your partner\\'s planets fall. Then we note in which of your partner\\'s 12 Houses your planets fall.\\n\\nSynastry Aspects (also called Inter-aspects) – These are aspects formed from planets and angles in one chart to the planets and angles in the second chart. Here is the \"nitty gritty\" of a relationship. The dynamics between you is revealed by synastry aspects.\\n\\nNothing so profoundly affects our lives as contact with others, so this subject should be entered into with compassion and a commitment to thoroughness. If you rush the process of synastry, you will make erroneous judgments about something so serious. It is too easy and common for people to compare just 1 or 2 synastry aspects and assume they have the entire relationship mapped out. This is usually a huge mistake. Do not bother with synastry if you will not take the time to consider all parts. A real relationship is always at stake.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/Synastry Art and Science- Synastry Aspects, Element Compatibility, House Overlays.html'}, page_content='The scientific part of synastry is that all aspects, house cusps, planets, points, and angles are calculated mathematically. In this sense, synastry (and all astrology) is mathematically precise. Allowable orbs for synastry aspects range according to the preference of the astrologer. Keep in mind, we exist in a universal energy field in which an energy influence increases as it comes near us or decreases as it departs. It doesn’t just appear or disappear. So we must be flexible with allowable orbs.\\n\\nThen the art of synastry is to paint a picture of this energy field that is erected between the two birth charts. Please don\\'t attempt to do this without some intermediate astrological knowledge. Especially regarding your own relationships! 99% of the time, you will not be objective regarding your own relationship synastry unless you are experienced in astrology.

The Rising sign is interchangeably called the Ascendant. It can be located on a natal chart as the sign on which the 1st House cusp falls. It is the sign that was at the eastern horizon point, from the viewpoint of your birth coordinates, at the moment of your birth. It rises on the path of the sun’s rise, and it changes degrees every few minutes. This is why an accurate birth time and place is so important for an accurate horoscope. A Rising sign can be different for twins born just a couple minutes apart. Further, this Ascendant point is the premises for the calculations of the rest of the house cusps. A few minutes of time difference shifts the entire chart.\\n\\nAstrology rising stars and sun, Classic Astrology Art\\n\\nThe Rising sign is like a direct connection between our Earth and the zodiac path. It is the zodiac sign that was “rising” over the Earth at the moment that we took our first breath, the point of intersection between the wheel of personal Houses and the celestial zodiac wheel. It represents our appearance in the world. The Rising sign is the image we project, the impression we make on others, the way we take action in the world, and the lasting effect we have on the environment. The Rising sign is often described as a public mask that we wear, since it tends to be how people see us, especially strangers who don’t know our deeper selves. But in fact, the Rising sign is not like a mask because wearing a mask denotes some level of falsity or hiding oneself. Your Rising Sign characteristics are not a \"fake cover-up\" as a mask would imply. Those characteristics are a real and true part of who your are, more like a face than a mask. Even though your face is shallow and external, you\\'re stuck with it and cannot take it off! It\\'s a real part of you, not fake. And people usually perceive it in ways that you yourself do not. That\\'s a Rising Sign for you – others see you as the embodiment of those characteristics, even though you might not see yourself like that.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/What is a Rising Sign_Ascendant – Astrology Lesson 6.html'}, page_content='Your Sun sign is your true self, but it’s like the frame of a car, which is not so visible underneath the doors, bumpers and shiny paint. The Rising sign is how people perceive us because it is the style that we use to go about meeting the needs of our Sun sign. For example, a Capricorn-Sun person is ambitious, reserved, and needs order. But coupled with a Sagittarius-Rising sign, the person will appear care-free and un-ambitious, while all the time working hard to reach its Capricornian goals.\\n\\nWe tend to behave more like our Rising sign when we are surrounded by strangers, or in new situations, like job interviews. But still, it tends to be our personal style at all times. Personal style does not represent our deepest needs, though (like the Moon). A study of the Rising sign is best used as a tool to understand why people behave the way they do. The Rising sign is also said to describe our physical characteristics – our looks. For example, Libra-Rising is beautiful, Pisces-Rising has a dreamy appearance and small feet, Taurus-Rising is stocky with a thick neck, and so forth. We find this to be somewhat accurate most of the time. You try it and see.\\n\\nThe Rising sign is extremely important in the natal chart. The planet that rules the Rising sign is considered to be the chart ruler (planetary rulerships will be discussed in a later lesson). In practical terms, this means that every planet and sign in your natal chart is filtered through the Rising sign, or filtered through its ruling planet. Here is the most literal reason why we see people of the same Sun sign who behave so differently. They must obviously have different Rising signs.\\n\\nIn addition, people with the same Rising sign can also have different personalities because of the following: since the Rising sign is not as as basically fundamental as our Sun sign, it is greatly subject to the modifying influence of aspects. In other words, you don\\'t have a clear description of your Rising sign until you\\'ve blended in the energies of any planets aspecting the Ascendant. Example: A person with Leo Rising, but with Saturn in conjunction with the Ascendant will not be as bubbly and expressive as a typical \"Leo Rising\" person.'),\n",

If you prefer, see instead 4 Easy Birth Chart Reading Techniques For Beginners.)\\n\\n(Get your free birth chart and report here.)\\n\\nThe most important thing to remember while interpreting any birth chart is: synthesis. The entire chart must be taken as a whole. A natal chart abounds with bits and pieces of information about an individual. Each separate bit must be synthesized into one whole picture of the person.\\n\\nThis means that you cannot take one piece of the chart (for example, Mercury in Sagittarius) and decide that it defines the entire person. If you do that, you will, undoubtedly, be in error. Of course, you will be tempted to stop at one or another of the planetary meanings, and think that it is the defining factor of a person. This is a big mistake. For example, say that two individuals both have Mercury in Sagittarius (denoting something of a \"big mouth\"). You may be tempted to assume that both of the individuals are \"outspoken.\" But, say the first person has the Sun in Capricorn, while the second person has the Sun in Sagittarius. While they both have Mercury in Sagittarius, the first person (Sun in Capricorn) will have a much more reserved communication style than the second person (Sun in Sagittarius).\\n\\nThe point, again (and this point will be repeated often), is that the entire chart must be blended together. Yes, by all means, go ahead and see all the separate interpretations of each planet in its sign and house. But then you must weave it all together, and lace it with the Rising Sign, to get an accurate picture.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/How to Read Your Own Birth Chart – Astrology Lesson 10.html'}, page_content='It’s as if each of us is a mosaic, made up of tiny individual images. In the birth chart, each separate planet in a sign and house is like one tiny individual image, one tiny part of the whole mosaic. Now, two different completed mosaics, if you look close enough, may contain tiny pieces that are exactly the same, yet they are part of two completely different finished mosaics (this point is illustrated by the example of Mercury in Sagittarius above). Although the mosaics contain similar pieces, the final products look nothing alike. So what we’re saying here is the opposite of that age-old adage: \"Don\\'t judge a book by its cover.\" The opposite is \"Don’t judge a book by a single page inside.\" The work of the astrologer, then, is to take all the bits and pieces of insight in the birth chart and synthesize them into a whole. What emerges is an amazingly accurate portrait of an individual.\\n\\nInterpreting Planets in the Signs\\n\\nLook at the birth chart and take note of what sign and house each planet is in. (Check here if you need help remembering what the symbols/glyphs mean.) Here is a handy, printable worksheet that will help you keep track of your birth chart information. Also take note of the Ascendant\\'s sign (Rising Sign), and which house the Ascendant\\'s ruler occupies.\\n\\nNow you can look up the \"Chart Interpretations\" of each of your planets and Rising Sign.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/How to Read Your Own Birth Chart – Astrology Lesson 10.html'}, page_content='The zodiac sign will show how the planet is manifested. Previously, we likened the signs to \"stained-glass windows\" through which the planet is expressed. See if this analogy helps: envision a sentence, with a \"verb\" and an \"adverb.\" The planet is the \"verb\" while the zodiac sign is the \"adverb.\" For example, the Moon (feel, nurture, respond) in the sign of Capricorn (reservedly, coldly) denotes someone who nurtures in a cold and reserved way, or has trouble expressing emotions. That\\'s not a happy placement for the Moon, but remember: there\\'s more to the story…the rest of the chart. (See what each planet means in Lesson 5: The Planets. See what each zodiac sign means in Lesson 8: Zodiac Signs)\\n\\nIncorporating the Astrological Houses\\n\\nThe other thing to remember is that the planet in the sign will focus on the House. This means that the activity denoted by the planet will take place in the arena of your life designated by the House in which that planet falls. (Remember, each House represents a sphere of life – i.e. work, home, friendships, etc.) The planet is the \"what,\" the sign is \"how\" that \"what\" is done, and the House is \"where\" it takes place. Here is a handy reminder to use when interpreting your natal chart:\\n\\nPlanets = What? Signs = How? Houses = Where?\\n\\nThe following table explains it further.\\n\\nPlanets = “What” = energies; what you like to do Signs = “How” = the way you do it Houses = “Where” = areas of your life\\n\\nAn example of why taking the House into consideration is so important:\\n\\nSay a person has Saturn in Capricorn in the 7th House, which could manifest as a reserved (Capricorn) attitude in love relationships (7th House). Then, say this same individual has Venus in Sagittarius in the 11th House. This person will be friendly and outgoing (Sagittarius) in social situations and groups (11th House), but unemotional and detached (although dependable) in love relationships (Saturn in Capricorn in the 7th). (Astrology is a powerful tool for understanding those seemingly contradicting tendencies that we all have. The birth chart tells it all. With time and patience, you will be able to read all such details from a birth chart)'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/How to Read Your Own Birth Chart – Astrology Lesson 10.html'}, page_content=\"House Rulers (Signs on the Cusps)\\n\\nAnother influence on each House (in each department of life) is the ruling planet of the House. The ruling planet of each House in your natal chart is the planet that rules the sign on the cusp. For example, if you have Capricorn on the 7th House cusp, then Saturn is the Ruler of your 7th House, because Saturn rules Capricorn. The result is that Saturn will have an influence in the matters of your 7th House, regardless of which House Saturn is actually residing in. (Here is a table of the Sign Rulerships). The sign on each house cusp shows one's attitude towards the matters of that house, whereas planets in the house show actual circumstances. For example, Capricorn on the 7th House cusp denotes an attitude of reserve or caution towards forming partnerships. On the other hand, Saturn in the 7th house may denote actual problems transpiring in partnerships and in marriage. These are subtle differences that will perfect your interpretations when reading a birth chart.\\n\\nSo a House is influenced by any planets residing in that House, but also by the ruler of the House. Most of the time, the ruler will be in a different House. Many times, the goods of the House will be used for advantage in the House where the planetary ruler actually resides. For example, say you have Capricorn on the 7th House cusp, and Saturn (Capricorn's ruler) in the 2nd House. You may very well choose to marry (7th House) for money (ruler in 2nd House). This last statement brings us to our next point – a word of caution.\\n\\nA Word of Caution\\n\\nThe celestial configuration that took place at your moment of birth is a powerful indicator of your motivations, drives, preferences, and psychological makeup, but it does not seal your fate. It does show the potential you were born with, but what you do with that potential is up to you.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/How to Read Your Own Birth Chart – Astrology Lesson 10.html'}, page_content='Some astrologers mistakenly interpret birth charts by declaring the outcomes of the drives, or the external circumstances. They declare things that must definitively take place. But the correct way to interpret a birth chart is to declare the drives, strengths, weaknesses, preferences, needs, tendencies, and so forth. Astrology reveals our inner psychological makeup. The outcomes are for the individual to manifest for him/herself. For example, above it was mentioned that if you have Capricorn ruling your 7th House, and Saturn in the 2nd House, then you might marry for money. But the proper way to read that example is to declare that you \"have a need for security in your relationships. You have a need for security, but it does not necessarily mean that you will marry for money. You may very well choose to marry a pauper for true love. But be assured that your need for material security in relationships (as shown in your birth chart) will continue as a nagging feeling you won\\'t easily be rid of.\"\\n\\nThe natal chart never lies. The problem is when the natal chart is read incorrectly. Remember, instead of giving predestined predictions, you will be more precise to explain the potential. People choose what to do with their potential. As Henley wrote,\\n\\nI am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul.\"\\n\\nThe natal chart is one\\'s map.\\n\\nHere is another example, taken from history. Ancient astrologers, before psychology was popular, interpreted charts in a more fatalistic manner. If you were a Pisces, they would say that you would end up living in poverty (the \"starving artist\" stereotype) because you were such a \"weakling\". Modern astrologers understand the deeper psychological drives and needs that are represented by the planets and signs. Nowadays, we understand that Pisces has a need to transcend the mundane, and while he is very artistic, he is not fated to live in poverty. Pisces simply does not prioritize money or materials. He could be poor, or he could be rich. Either way, the Pisces will prioritize the intangible over the tangible – which is how we interpret it today. The interpretation shifted from a predetermined fate (poverty), to a psychological drive (need for artistic/spiritual transcendence) that may result in any circumstantial fate.\\n\\nRemembering Aspects'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/How to Read Your Own Birth Chart – Astrology Lesson 10.html'}, page_content=\"Remembering Aspects\\n\\nDon't forget the aspects. If you attempt to make an interpretation without considering the aspects, you will be in error. Interpretations for each planet in sign and house must be modified according to the nature of the aspects. Aspects can soften things and bring ease to otherwise troublesome planetary placements, or they can bring conflict to otherwise pleasant planetary placements. Aspects stimulate the planets.\\n\\nEvery planet has both easy and difficult (or positive and negative) manifestations. For example, the sun's energy can be expressed as a generous pouring forth of self and creativity, or prideful arrogance and an excessive desire to be special. Aspects from other planets tell whether the energies will be expressed easily and positively (if it receives trines & sextiles), or with struggle and conflict (if it receives squares or oppositions). Again, a birth chart interpretation without accounting for aspects is incorrect, or at least incomplete. (See Lesson 9: Aspects in Astrology)\\n\\nMost important aspects to look for:\\n\\nTake immediate notice of conjunctions to any of the four angles (this means conjunctions to the Ascendant, M.C., Descendant, I.C.). When a planet makes a conjunction to one of the angles, the influence of that planet may be the strongest influence in the chart. The person will identify very strongly with the traits of that planet. This is explained in detail in: The Meaning of a Planet in Conjunction To 1 of Your Angles.\\n\\nAlso take notice of conjunctions made by the outer planets (Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto) to the inner planets (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, and Mars). These conjunctions will drastically alter the interpretation for the inner planet by adding its own qualities. A conjunction from Uranus adds rebelliousness and innovation; a conjunction from Neptune adds confusion or sadness and/or inspiration and magic, and a conjunction from Pluto adds power, but can be a bit creepy.\\n\\nFor example, a Leo-Sun person who has Pluto making a conjunction aspect with their Sun will be very Plutonian. This person would be one of the most silent and secretive Leos ever.\\n\\nBalance of Elements and Qualities\"),\n",

If you feel overwhelmed with all this new information, then you should simply try this step first. This is the easiest interpretation that can be derived from a natal chart, even for inexperienced people. This is how it\\'s done:\\n\\nNote the element of the sign of each planet, and that of the ascendant, and of the midheaven. This printable worksheet will help you. Then simply count how many are fire, air, Earth, and water. Count the Sun\\'s and the Moon\\'s element for 2 each, because they are such a strong influence. It\\'s common to have a combination of elements, say 3 or 4 of each. However, should you find an imbalance, such as 5 or more of an element, or 0 to 1 of an element, this will say something about the overall temperament of the individual. Five or more of one element will make that the \"Predominant Element\" in the individual. It is interesting to note that the Predominant Element may be different from that of the Sun sign. In this case, the person will behave even less like their Sun sign – yet another reason why we cannot define a person simply by their Sun sign. If a chart is completely lacking in an element, or if there is only 1 planet in an element, that will be considered the \"Weakest Element.\" The \"General Interpretations\" on the following page will include interpretations for Predominant and Weakest Elements.\\n\\nThe same method is used to tally up the balance of qualities (Cardinal, Fixed, Mutable) of each planet, ascendant, and midheaven. This gives only subtle information, unless you find a great imbalance, such as a complete lack of one quality, or 6 or more of one quality.

This introduction explains why relationship astrology is reliable for finding genuine happiness in love.\\n\\nFor starters, we each have different preferences and different needs. Mainstream relationship advice, whether it comes from psychologists, books, or other media, is extremely limited in its capacity to be effective simply because they all ignore that one precious fact: each human is unique, with different preferences and different needs.\\n\\nThere is not one universal definition of a good relationship or lover. Ladies, it’s a waste of time to try and fit the mold of the popular media’s definition of a great girlfriend because that definition may not attract the man that satisfies you. Men, it’s a waste of time to follow rigid dating tips that may not appeal to the woman of your dreams.\\n\\nSo how do know what attracts or appeals to the lover of your dreams? More importantly, what attracts or appeals to you? What type of man/woman is the lover of your dreams? What do you need in a lover, in a relationship, in a spouse? You may think you know the answer to these questions. However, popular media may be influencing you to seek qualities that are not your natural preferences.\\n\\nThat ultimately results in failed relationships.\\n\\nOn the other hand, relationship astrology reveals your legitimate preferences. It is surprisingly thorough at detailing all the little things that we love and hate in relationships. Astrology is an extremely effective tool for illuminating each individual’s preferences and needs, including your hidden subconscious desires. Astrology reveals your psychological makeup and your hidden drives.\\n\\nYou can test this out by reading the description of your own Venus sign: Venus in the Signs. (Note that the description of your Venus sign will be an incomplete picture of your love style because a complete description must include aspects and other astrological factors.)\\n\\nThe benefit of astrology is that it reveals your unique and true love styles, love needs, and love preferences.\\n\\nWhy is this important?\\n\\nWhen you awaken your deeply-embedded love style, you awaken the love energy that can attract a naturally compatible lover. Relationships between naturally compatible people invite happiness and genuine satisfaction into our lives.\\n\\nSagittarius Couple Holding Hands on Swing Set\\n\\nRelated\\n\\nSynastry Interpretations\\n\\nLove & Relationship Articles\\n\\nCite This Page\\n\\nMLA style'),\n",

You can instead go to zodiac sign descriptions. Or, for just the dates of the zodiac signs, see below.)\\n\\nWhat are the zodiac signs? The ancient Babylonians created the zodiac wheel by first splitting our sky into four sections designated by the yearly equinoxes and solstices (the turning points of the four yearly seasons).\\n\\nEach of these four sections of sky were split into 3 sections measuring 30 degrees each. This gives us a full 360-degree zodiac circle with 12 equal sections of 30 degrees each. Each 30-degree section is one zodiac sign, for a total of 12 zodiac signs (12, not 13). These 12 zodiac signs are not star constellations. The zodiac signs are 30-degree sections of space that were mathematically calculated in a way that was, and still is, intimately connected to our yearly seasons. (A Short History of Astrology)\\n\\nThe zodiac circle always assigns zero degrees of Aries (Aries, the zodiac sign, not the star constellation) to the Vernal Equinox (the Spring Equinox, or the first day of Spring in the northern hemisphere).\\n\\nThis zodiac wheel, also known as the tropical zodiac or western zodiac, is still accurate because we always align/begin it, as the ancients Greeks did, with the first day of Spring. This not a mistake. The zodiac wheel is intimately aligned with our Earth’s seasons. (This is an important fact to recognize. Some people today fail to recognize this fact, and so they erroneously claim that the zodiac wheel is misaligned. They do not understand that the Earth’s axial precession, or “precession of the equinoxes” does not impair the zodiac wheel.)\\n\\nThe ancient Babylonians used the constellations that appeared in the general area of each zodiac sign as placeholders. They designated 12 constellations to represent the 12 zodiac signs in the sky. The star constellations, with their varying degrees and sizes, are not the actual zodiac signs. These constellations were named after the zodiac signs they represent, not the other way around!\\n\\nZodiac signs wheel with sun in center. Ancient astrology art.'),\n",

Ancient astrology art.\\n\\nThere were no cute animals or mythical creatures associated with them yet. Different energies were observed to correlate with the position of the planets in different sections of the heavens. These 12 signs became 12 different archetypes, each with their own characteristics.\\n\\n(Notice how the 12 archetypes recur in history: 12 Gods of Olympus, 12 sons of Abraham, 12 tribes of Israel, 12 Apostles of Jesus Christ, 12 Successors to the Prophet Muhammad).\\n\\nThe 12 archetypes, or zodiac signs, already had their traits before the ancient Greeks attached the popular symbols to them. The Greeks had the uncanny brilliance of choosing symbols that parallel the sign traits very closely. So now, when we think of the sign of Aries, we think of a ram; when we think of Sagittarius, we think of an archer, and so on. This lesson will not delve into the mythological stories behind the choice of symbols for the signs. We will give a topical, general description of the archetype of each sign.\\n\\nTo clarify, the following descriptions of the zodiac signs refer to the archetype of the sign itself, regardless of which planet is in the sign. We will describe the zodiac sign as if it were a person, with characteristics. In other words, the following descriptions do not specifically or exclusively apply to people with the Sun in that sign. This is because the Sun sign is not the only defining characteristic of a person. While the Sun sign is important, it is by no means the complete story of our personal profile.\\n\\nlight shining through stained glass window\\n\\nOur Moon sign, Rising sign, Mercury sign, Venus sign, and all the rest are just as important in giving us a complete picture of ourselves. We all have the entire zodiac in our charts – all 12 zodiac signs. For this reason, it is important to learn the traits of all the signs. Planets in the signs will be expressed according to the traits of the sign they are in. Thus, the zodiac signs modify the planets. Each zodiac sign is like a stained-glass window through which the planets must pass to manifest in our lives. Each \"window\" is different. And different planets through the same \"window\" will also be different.

If you prefer, see zodiac compatibility instead, or the synastry interpretations.)\\n\\nBefore attempting to determine compatibility between 2 people, check each birth chart separately to determine what each individual’s capacity to relate is? How well matched are their needs for intimacy? How well do the individual life goals, styles, and rhythms blend? If their life goals don’t match up well, all the compatibility in the world will not help such star-crossed lovers.\\n\\nAnswer the 4 following questions:\\n\\nHow comfortable is each with their biologic role and how well do these roles match up? How well does each relate to their own and the opposite sex? Those at ease with the opposite sex will be frustrated when trying to form a relationship with someone who is not. Do not assume that others function the same as you do, as that will plant the seeds of friction and annoyance when you find that they do not. Look at the aspects of the Sun, Moon, Venus and Mars in the birth chart. Then check your aspects in the following 3 tables to see what those aspects signify.\\n\\nDo you Play Well with Males?\\n\\nLook at Sun's Aspects\\n\\nif Sun has several good aspects; no squares or oppositions of Sun\\n\\nGenerally at ease & comfortable with males, and comfortable playing society's expected role towards males\\n\\nif Sun is unaspected, or only lightly aspected\\n\\nMales will not play a significant role in one's life\\n\\nif Sun has hard aspects (squares or oppositions)\\n\\nRelating to males (whether father, friend, or lover) is stressful & anxious; has difficulty accepting society's demands in relating to males\\n\\ncompatibility with males, father, son, grandfather\\n\\nrelationship compatibility with females\\n\\nDo you Play Well with Females?\\n\\nLook at Moon's Aspects\\n\\nif Moon makes harmonious aspects – conjunctions, trines and sextiles\\n\\nRelates easily and happily to females\\n\\nif Moon makes no, or minimal, aspects\\n\\nInteraction with females is generally unimportant, routine, or obligatory\\n\\nif Moon makes hard aspects\\n\\nFinds female qualities irritating or demanding (either in themselves or others)\\n\\nCan you be Happy in Love and Sex?\\n\\nif Venus has good aspects; no squares or oppositions\"),\n",

If these houses clash with those of your partner, conflict down the line will be inevitable regardless of how compatible your personalities are. A person\\'s life goals are almost always (I dare say, always) related to one of these houses. These houses signify those things you want to do when you retire, or when you win the lottery.

Fall for Illusions?\\n\\nLook at House of Neptune\\n\\nThe House containing Neptune is the area of life that is always just out of reach. This is the sphere of life that will seemingly forever elude us in finding completeness. Yet, in this house, we endlessly chase illusions and fulfillments. We have big dreams for this house, but only limited success. Couples beware of your expectations regarding your partner\\'s Neptune house! No doubt, this is the most inspired and inspiring house in the birth chart, the only one where fantasy can become real, but here…what you see is not always what you get. Dreams can come true in your Neptune house (Oprah has Neptune in her House of Career), but more often than not, Neptune leaves us swimming in a deep pool of delusion and fantasy. Can you swim in your partner’s Neptune house? Better yet, have you got room in your boat? More about Neptune in the Houses.\\n\\nWhat’s your Love Language?\\n\\nWhat type of relating energy exists in each chart? Sexual energy? Emotional energy? Companionability? Permanence? These can be seen as relating \"languages.\" Understanding the partner\\'s love language can help avoid feelings of rejection. For example, if one partner naturally pours much emotionally and/or physically into the relationship, but the other is, by nature, much less emotionally or sexually energetic, this can be misinterpreted as disinterest or lack of commitment to the relationship. We really only understand love in our own \"love language.\" If your partner speaks fire and you speak water, you will both feel like you don\\'t love each other. Loving someone in that scenario will require a lot of work. And unfortunately, you will not easily appreciate the effort because it will usually be in a language foreign to your heart.\\n\\nA different way of understanding these energy levels is to see them like radio frequencies. Fire, air, water, and earth are different radio frequencies, or radio stations. If you are a water person, then you are tuned into the water station. You will not pick up love vibes coming from the fire or air station. They may be breaking their head trying to prove love to you, but you will not be receiving it because you are tuned in to the water station.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, water and earth signs are compatible with each other. Air and fire signs are compatible with each other.'),\n",

Water needs an emotional, soul-merging to feel love. Water Venus loves deeply and shows it by caring about your well-being and your feelings. Touching and talking alone will not satisfy this Venus; they need to \"feel\" love from you in order to be satisfied in love.\\n\\nFire signs bring the most physical energy (read: sexual energy). Fire Venus needs to be active together to feel love; fun outings, adventurous vacations, etc. And tons of sex. Fire Venus people can seem self-centered because when in love, they feel it coming from inside them, rather than being based on the other person. The other person may be in front of them saying, \"hello, look at me,\" but Fire Venus ignores because they are too busy being consumed with love. They love passionately.\\n\\nEarth signs bring stability and durability (read: a keeper) to partnerships, but have a more limited emotional range. Earthy Venus people need your physical presence near them, but don\\'t get mushy because they won\\'t have it. Emotional expressions should be limited to what you want for dinner, or which movie you want to see. They handle physical and material needs, not emotional ones. Earthy Venus is faithful. In bed, you will appreciate their mastery of the physical. They are sensual.'),\n",

Air Venus needs companionship, someone to talk to, someone to hang out with, someone to watch movies with. (But most of all, someone to talk to.) These are friendly people, and even in love, the relationship may seem more like a friendship. This may sound nice, but if you need deep emotional bonding, you will not find it here.

We tend to reassess, rewrite, and focus on the portion of our lives indicated by the house that Saturn is transiting at any given time. Knowing this ahead of time helps to distinguish between genuine and durable compatibility and just a temporary coincidence of meshing desires. A person is highly unlikely to begin or endure in a real relationship if Saturn is not transiting through a \"relationship house.\" (Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto transits can direct our focus, as well, but Saturn is more solidly felt).\\n\\nLook to the house that Saturn, the great time-clock of our lives, is transiting.

Earth and water are compatible with each other, and they are the yin elements.\\n\\nIn general, we can see eye to eye with people of our compatible elements. It’s best to start with compatible Sun-sign elements (both yin or both yang). This is really the ideal. Some astrologers say there are so-called compensations for incompatible Sun elements that can make for a bearable relationship. But we tend to disagree. Yang (fire & air) and Yin (earth & water) just don’t see eye to eye. This isn’t necessarily bad, but you will spend a great deal of time explaining yourself to each other. If you are dominant yang energy, you will notice that you need to put in extra effort to understand a yin person, and vice versa. Communication will not be smooth in such a relationship.\\n\\nBeing in a long-term relationship with the wrong energy can actually be detrimental to your health. It’s doable, but not always healthy.\\n\\nThe ideal is compatible Sun elements. If the Suns are compatible, everything else can be worked on.

You can check which Sun signs are compatible with your own on the Zodiac Signs Compatibility page.\\n\\nIn addition, compatible Moon elements, Rising sign elements, and Venus sign elements are desirable. The more the better. Compatibility is all about this elemental energy flowing smoothly. Incompatible elements are like gears of a transmission grinding against each other instead of flowing smoothly.

This is not to say that the planets (or the signs) cause anything to happen. What we observe is synchrony – that things are taking place in sync. One movement is flowing throughout our space, heavens, and Earth. Instead of causing, the planets indicate things, describing what is already taking place. But for the sake of convenience, astrologers use phrases like, “your Venus makes you like this,” or “his Mars made him act like that.” Please note that this is only for convenience in communicating. Astrologers know that the planets don’t force us to do anything, any more than your 5:00pm clock forces you to stop working. But you do stop working when the clock strikes 5:00pm, don’t you? And so you pay careful attention to that clock, because that clock will show you when it’s time to go home from work. But the clock never forced you to leave work, neither did it ever seal your fate.

The ten planets of astrology are: Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto[1]. (From our geocentric position, Earth is not included in the list; however Earth\\'s interplay in the scheme of things is denoted by the Ascendant.) However, before the 18th century only the first seven planets were recognized (they were perceivable to the naked eye): Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Since over 2,000 years ago, the seven classical planets were observed to keep time, orbiting steadily on their paths. Perhaps that is why the number seven was symbolic of deity in ancient cultures. The seven were named after Greek gods because their influence was considered to be as such. Seven was the number of days chosen for a week, with each day borrowing its name from one of the classical planets. (The days making up our calendar month were determined based on one complete cycle through the 12 zodiac signs by the moon, from which the word \"month\" comes from.)\\n\\nThe discoveries of Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto corresponded to revolutionary changes in our world, from the Industrial Revolution and discovery of electricity (Uranus), to the financial collapse and interest in world domination of the 1930’s (Pluto). Pluto’s demotion of status to a “dwarf planet” does not change the fact that it is a celestial body participating in the continuous flow of energy in our world. Thus, Pluto is included here as a planet. (Astrology also observes several other asteroids/planetoids, regardless of planetary status. The body is there, thus, it counts.)\\n\\nEach planet symbolizes a different component of life, a different type of energy.

The artist outlines your general shape, the planes and angles of your face, the way in which you hold your body. In the same way, your sun sign delineates your fundamental character, your core. Are you introspective? Do you make friends easily? Are you pompous or plain, generous or greedy? How do you cope with responsibility? Are you high-strung or easygoing? The answers may be found in a study of your Sun's position by sign and house, and any aspects from it.\\n\\nInterpretations for the Sun in each zodiac sign are available here: Sun in the Signs\\n\\nInterpretations for the Sun in each House of the birth chart: Sun in Houses\\n\\nReturn to Top Return to Leo\\n\\nfull moon planet\\n\\nThe Moon\\n\\n“I feel”\\n\\nBest quality: Adaptability Worst quality: Inconstancy\"),\n",

The Sun sign is a part of you that is apparent to others; it is what others see. The Moon sign is the part of you that you see. The Moon represents your emotional nature and instinctive reactions – emotional responses based on past experiences and unconscious habit patterns that you have developed. It comprises all the little surface peculiarities, moods, and changes that have to do with physical life which are disturbing, fleeting, and changing. It describes the way you behave in instances in which you haven’t had time to think things through, your immediate emotional responses. Have you ever done something that you immediately regretted and thought, “that’s not like me.” It may have been your Moon sign qualities at work. The sign that the Moon is in shows what makes you feel emotionally nurtured, secure, and satisfied. Because emotions run so deep, the Moon sign represents your greatest need. It also shows how you nurture others. Most of the time, your Moon sign will only be apparent to those who live with you, or people that are very close to you. In many ways, your Moon personality is the one you keep hidden. It is your inner core, which feels hate, jealousy, fear, and has fantasies that you often deny even to yourself. On the other hand, it is your Moon personality that spontaneously feels and expresses joy and pleasure. It is the part of you that enjoys the little sensualities of life. The Moon in your horoscope modifies your Sun sign; it brings new forces, different motivations, and spiritual elements to the character of your Sun sign. For example, a Gemini-Sun person with Moon in Taurus will be more dependable than a Gemini-Sun with Moon in Aquarius. Here is another reason why we cannot define a person simply by their Sun sign.'),\n",

Things ruled by Venus include: what kind of sex appeal you posses, love affairs, the arts, beauty and beautiful things, adornment, affection, the social graces, harmony, and friendship. Being the planet of pleasure, it points to the kinds of amusements you are drawn to and in what ways you spend your money. The position of Venus in your natal chart can answer such questions as: What kind of lovers do you attract? Are you flirtatious? Do you find happiness in your love affairs, or are you often disappointed? Where do your creative talents lie? The sign of Venus gives important information about how you expresses yourself in personal relationships, especially in love and marriage.

You have to want something before you reach out and take it; Mars is the heated passion behind action. Mars shows your ability to turn ideas into action. The sign of Mars in your natal chart indicates your vitality, energy level, and style of action. In a female's chart, the Mars sign is one factor suggesting the type of man she attracts. In its highest form, Mars represent your unleashed energy and your human will – initiative. A controlled Mars can give a healthy dose of assertiveness and ambition.

Jupiter brings joy to life. Think expansiveness and abundance, as Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system. Jupiter signifies knowledge, higher leaning, breadth of vision, confidence, charity and good-will, frankness and honesty. Jupiter’s knowledge is on a philosophical level (as opposed to Mercury’s day-to-day cleverness). It is the broad view of the higher mind. Psychologically, Jupiter is the search for meaning or truth. As such, it represents law and justice, philosophy, religion, metaphysics, and education. Jupiter encompasses the urge for self-improvement through participation in the larger whole. It urges you to go forth exploring life. Jupiter\\'s sign indicates what you idealize, what your ethical, religious, and philosophical standards are. The sign also indicates where you express expansiveness, where you do things on a large scale. Jupiter in your chart shows where you are likely to receive financial and material benefits, and in turn, where you express generosity to others. The House of Jupiter is where we tend to be optimistic, and the affairs of that House usually flow easily. Jupiter’s qualities include benevolence (kindness), wisdom, morality, and spirituality. If negatively placed in the chart, Jupiter’s energy can be manifested as self-righteousness, excessiveness, squandering, exaggeration, over-indulgence, superficiality, and bigotry. However, even when negatively positioned, Jupiter is protective and beneficial. Over-indulgence and excess often lead to learning the lesson of restraint. Even with a negatively-aspected Jupiter, a person will tend to \"land on their feet\" when problems arise in the areas signified by Jupiter\\'s House.\\n\\nInterpretations for Jupiter in each zodiac sign are available here: Jupiter in the Signs\\n\\nInterpretations for Jupiter in each House of the birth chart: Jupiter in Houses\\n\\nReturn to Top Return to Sagittarius\\n\\nastrology planet saturn with ring\\n\\nSaturn\\n\\n“I achieve”\\n\\nBest quality: System and Organization Worst quality: Selfishness'),\n",

When Venus wishes for love, Saturn denies her. When Jupiter promises good fortune, Saturn delays it. When Mercury brings news, Saturn degrades it, and when Mars goes too hard or too fast, Saturn will crash him. But this is not necessarily bad. Saturn is associated with the principles of limitation, restrictions, boundaries, safety, practicality, reality, seriousness, and structures. Saturn is the laws, boundaries and limits set by society or karma. Modern astrologers acknowledge that the hardships brought on by Saturn\\'s limitations, compel one to continue striving for a final product, that although delayed, will be solid and of real worth.\\n\\nSaturn governs ambition, career, authority, hierarchy, and conforming social structures. It concerns a person\\'s sense of duty, discipline and responsibility, and their physical and emotional endurance during hardships. Saturn is morose and cold, melancholic, and serious. By placement in your chart, it indicates the area of life in which you may feel shame, for a time. This is the area where you have lessons to learn. But this is where your disciplined hard work will lead to genuinely earned, long-lasting success. At its best, Saturn endows organization and order. At its worst, Saturn’s energy is manifested as selfishness. The sign of Saturn also gives clues to the kind of work for which a person is suited and the kind of career he is likely to pursue.\\n\\nInterpretations for Saturn in each zodiac sign are available here: Saturn in the Signs\\n\\nInterpretations for Saturn in each House of the birth chart: Saturn in Houses\\n\\nReturn to Top Return to Capricorn\\n\\nastrology planet uranus on its side with ring\\n\\nUranus\\n\\n“I evolve”\\n\\nBest quality: Originality Worst quality: Rebellion'),\n",

Like a lightning bolt, Uranus symbolizes sudden flashes of insight, moments of revelation, and spurts of creativity. Uranus’s energy is usually described as suddenness, revolution, change, shock, and disruption. Like lightning, Uranus breaks into time and fractures our patterns. New ideas break into ordinary streams of thought, bringing innovative solutions to stubborn problems. It is your intuition awakening you to a world beyond our social structure. Uranus forces sudden changes when the usefulness of the old is gone and something newer, something higher and better is ready to take its place. Uranus encompasses technology and all types of electronic devices. Uranus speeds up the mind, making it to bypass logic and arrive at conclusions by leaping from A to Z, shocking people. Uranus seeks alternatives to the common and accepted forms. True to itself, the planet Uranus stands out from the rest of the planets by orbiting around on its \"side.\" The rest of the planets orbit like a \"spinning top,\" but Uranus insists on rolling on its side like a ball. At best, Uranus encourages originality, versatility and independence. At worst, it encourages eccentricity, perversion and rebellion.

While Uranus breaks into our dimension to allow momentary flashes of insight into other realms of existence, Neptune is those other realms. Neptune dissolves life’s patterns in order to teach new meanings in the quest for universal wisdom. Neptune represents things that aren’t quite as they appear, the illusive, and the unreal. It is the planet of receptivity, imagination, cloudiness, confusion, delusion, illusion, and unreality. Neptune is also associated with movies, acting, and compassion. Neptune can indicate mystical visions of a divine creator, or an experience of the primordial chaos before creation (dangerously, the latter can drive one to madness). Neptune can indicate spiritual healing and service to others, or becoming lost in a foggy world of fantasy and dreams. More often than not, Neptune indicates confusion in the House where it resides in your birth chart. A negatively positioned Neptune in the natal chart can indicate a tendency to escape reality. The house and sign will indicate whether it be through mind-altering drugs and alcohol, day-dreaming, sexual addiction, cult worship, psychosis, potential suicide, or others. At its best, Neptune's energy inspires marvelous art, music, theatre, dance, poetry, and film.

Pluto represents sexuality (the act itself, as opposed to the energetic desire which is associated with Mars), obsessive desires, transformation, power, and the ingredients of great wealth (investments, banking, loans, debt, mortgages). Pluto has dominion over drastic changes that bring true upheavals. Since Pluto is the slowest-moving planet, an entire generation will share the same Pluto sign, giving it historical importance. Drastic and permanent changes in civilization as a whole can be linked to Pluto\\'s movement through the signs. On a personal level, the House that Pluto occupies in your chart will show how Plutonian energy is manifested in your life. Pluto will transform those things in your life that require regeneration, whether you desire it or not. You may experience dramatic crises or have to endure terrible suffering where Pluto is involved in your chart, but for the purpose of healing. Pluto tears down only to transform and regenerate what has been destroyed. Pluto is associated with recklessness, mental obsession and compulsion, emotional resistance, and overall transcendence.

These three classifications essentially define the zodiac signs. Just by knowing the element, quality, and polarity, you would be able to describe the fundamental traits of each zodiac sign without actually learning the sign. This is a very important lesson, indeed.\\n\\nThe author considers this the single most important lesson of the zodiac. The elements, qualities, and polarities are the fundamental, underlying nature of each zodiac sign. Learn these!\\n\\nElements | Qualities | Polarities\\n\\nZodiac Elements\\n\\nThe element of a zodiac sign reveals the basic temperament of the sign. The element of your Sun, Moon, or Rising sign are of significant importance, but the overall distribution of elements in your chart is what counts the most. Having more than 4 planets in an element will have an impact on your behavior, even if that element does not correspond to your Sun sign. An abundance (5 or more), or a lack (0-2), of an element has much impact on your temperament. See Balance of Elements.\\n\\nThere are four zodiac elements, with three zodiac signs belonging to each element group. The elements are interchangeably called \"triplicities;\" this is because there are three (triple) signs per element. The four elements are Fire, Earth, Air, and Water.\\n\\nFire Zodiac Element\\n\\nThe fire signs are Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius. Fire signs respond to energy very quickly. They favor action. They\\'re ready to go, take a risk, start a business, go on a trip, etc. They are confident, idealistic, intense, and approach life with zest and enthusiasm.

Aquarius is popular with friends and is unstoppable when it has a cause to champion. Air signs are into ideas and people.

They indicate how the signs express their element, meaning the mode of behavior they use to express the element needs. There are three qualities: Cardinal, Fixed, and Mutable. They are also called \"quadruplicities\" because there are 4 signs per group.

Their mode of activity is to start new things. They easily begin things and respond well to new ideas. They are self-starters. Crisis motivates them. They achieve control by remaining one step ahead of everyone else. Aries seeks leadership and control in general, Cancer controls emotions, home, and family; Libra tries to control partnerships; Capricorn controls, uses, and exploits the material environment.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/Elements Qualities Polarities – Astrology Lesson 7.html'}, page_content=\"Fixed Signs\\n\\nTaurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius\\n\\nFixed Signs are the most stable and self-contained. Their mode of activity is sort of passive, yet determined, unwavering, and even stubborn. Their strength is their consistency and loyalty. They follow things through to the end, managing and sustaining what has been started by the Cardinal signs. They may go to denial in times of change. They are very resistant to change, needing to take time to prep themselves. They tend to be late: Taurus is just slow; Scorpio uses tardiness as a subtle power struggle; Leo enjoys making an entrance; Aquarius wants things on their own terms. Late, but once there, they stay forever. The four Fixed signs are at the middle month of each season.\\n\\nMutable Signs\\n\\nGemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces\\n\\nMutable Signs are the most unstable and most open to influence by the environment. Their mode of activity is to make the transition from the old to the new, opening the way for the Cardinal Signs to begin a new cycle. They are infinitely flexible and tolerant. They find it naturally easy to let go. Whereas Cardinal signs begin new things, and Fixed signs sustain things, Mutable energy loosens structures and adapts it to new and changing conditions. With this territory comes mental worry. Mutable signs have many things going on in their heads rather than in tangible form. Many react by making lists. Some suffer from negative mental tension, involving fear, paranoia, and panic attacks. In anticipating negative outcomes, they really suffer during the worry process. But their high adaptability always sees them through. Gemini is changeable in its ideas; Virgo is dominated by its environment; Sagittarius has a continually changing view of life's possibilities; Pisces adapts itself superficially to its environment (like a chameleon) and reflects it like a mirror. Sometimes they compromise so much that they sacrifice their own interests. The four Mutable signs are at the final month of each season.\\n\\nBetween elements, qualities, and signs, there is only one combination of each, making each zodiac sign unique. For example, there is only 1 cardinal fire sign, only 1 cardinal earth sign, only 1 cardinal air sign, etc. You can understand the nature of each sign by examining these energetic combinations.

The difference between “initial attraction” and “compatibility” is great, for the first never ensures the second, and the second can manifest without the first, as many of us are forced to find out in the course of our lives. Here we focus on compatibility, and whether it exists between two people who are already past the “initial attraction” stage of a relationship.\\n\\nCompatibility between two people is not so much a thing, as it is the absence of a thing – absence of friction. Now, compatibility is not simply the sort of harmony that takes place when we are on a romantic date. Men and women tend to be on their best behavior on a date, putting their best foot forward and performing all the charming niceties that are expected from a romantic encounter. In a way, it can be said that people on dates are performing an act. There will be an illusion of compatibility on any romantic date, even between incompatible lovers. This is not a true measure of compatibility because the people in those cases are acting a part.\\n\\nCompatibility Relationship, Compatible couple, man and woman in movie theater\\n\\nTrue compatibility can only be determined based on our natural dispositions, our real personalities, our deep-seated mannerisms and habits. It can only be determined on “the morning after,” when the charming date from the night before reveals his/her ordinary habits, peculiar quirks, eccentricities and other daily behaviors. Often, these daily idiosyncrasies are what drives couples apart or attracts genuine admiration.\\n\\nSo, compatibility is the lucky situation in which both partners can be themselves without irritating each other. If you have to alter your behavior or style so as not to annoy your partner, then compatibility is lacking. Also, if you have to grit your teeth to acquiesce to your partner’s expression of his/herself, compatibility is lacking. If simply being yourselves causes friction with each other, compatibility is lacking.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/Compatibility in Love Relationships _ AstroLibrary.html'}, page_content='This is really a matter of energy flow. For example, try joining the positive ends of two magnets. They will not stick together regardless of how “attractive” or “charming” they are. Their energies repel each other. Humans are similar to magnets because we are part of a universal field consisting of an ebb and flow of energy. But unlike magnets, we humans are very complex, and we have many more points to consider than just “positive” and “negative.” Everyone has some great qualities, but not everyone is compatible with you.\\n\\nSince compatibility is really a matter of smooth energy flow between two people, not much can be done to “fix” an incompatible union. An incompatible couple is one in which the natural energy of one partner clashes with the natural energy of the other. It is unfair and sad that many divorcing and separating couples hurt each other in great proportions by bashing each other’s personalities, when the real problem may be a simple mismatch of energies (like repelling magnets).\\n\\nIncompatible couples can possibly succeed in a relationship, but it will require a lot of work and planned romantic dates. You may get along during the artificial scenarios (dates), but the incompatible partner will always rub you the wrong way just by being him/herself when you are not on a date. Their natural manner of being will irritate you. This is because your energies don’t blend well. As a result, the union creates tension, stress, and unhappiness.\\n\\nCompatible couples do not need many extras; they can simply enjoy being in each other’s presence. They can be themselves without causing friction in the relationship. This is because their energies flow together nicely. As a result, such a union creates happiness.\\n\\nOf course, no two people are perfectly compatible in every way (not that we are aware of). Compatibility, as we know it, exists in levels. Higher levels of compatibility result in happier relationships.\\n\\nAstrology, as the unique language of energy, is the most powerful tool available for determining compatibility, before risking years in a relationship. But even if you’ve been married for years, astrology can actually pinpoint the deep root of problem areas in your relationship. Astrology helps people learn how to deal with each other because it reveals the inner workings of their psyches. Even if you are stuck with an incompatible partner, astrology will get you to say, “Now I know why he/she is like that.”'),\n",

They are 2 different wheels.\\n\\nThe zodiac wheel is based on the sun’s apparent yearly rotation about our Earth, along the ecliptic.\\n\\nThe wheel of Houses is based on our Earth’s 24-hour rotation about its own axis.\\n\\nThe 2 wheels join together at points derived by calculations involving your exact birth time and astronomical birth coordinates.\\n\\nThen, the planets are described in 2 ways: as being in a zodiac sign, and also as being in a House.\\n\\nFor example, two people may both have a Libra Sun sign, but one may have the Libra Sun in his 12th House, while the other may have his Libra Sun in his 1st house. This could make for two very different types of people.\\n\\n(Another reason why the popular daily Sun Sign Horoscopes are a bunch of silliness: they are written assuming everyone has their Sun in the 1st House.)\\n\\nThe 12 Houses of astrology are symbolic of the all the departments that make up human life. The planets and zodiac signs will manifest themselves most strongly in the sphere of life represented by the House in which they fall on your chart (and also in the House which they rule; more on House Rulerships below).\\n\\nRemember, the houses are not “energies” like the elements or planets, nor do they color the expression of energies like the zodiac signs do. The houses are WHERE these energies are most likely to manifest. The houses are the fields of experience, not the experience themselves.\\n\\nNotice how the order of the Houses follows the developmental path of a human’s life, from the original impulse of individual being (1st house), to learning what is “mine” and how to use what one owns (2nd house), to learning how to communicate within the limitations set by our environment (3rd house), etc. The following description of the Houses are short and topical, directed at beginners.'),\n",

Because, until very recently, marriage was not entered into for pleasure, for love, nor for personal fulfillment.

If you prefer, see Synastry Interpretations instead.)\\n\\nHouse Overlays say a great deal about how you see each other, what you expect out of each other, and in which areas of life you affect each other. The planets overlaid in the Houses of another person reveal how the planet person (person who’s planets are in your houses) perceives the house person (person who’s birthchart houses the other’s planets are overlayed upon). The planet person will then have expectations according to their perceptions of the house person. The planet person will act accordingly. This, in turn, evokes a response from the house person. Here begin the dynamics of the relationship. Then we flip the whole thing to see the 2nd person’s planets in the 1st person’s houses.\\n\\nHouse overlays are the secret to knowing how that special guy or girl really sees you. House overlays don’t necessarily describe how compatible you are based on your personalities. They reveal how you see each other. How we perceive each other largely determines how we treat each other, and whether or not we’ll even approach each other. Are they intimidated by you? Are they mesmerized? Are they disgusted?\\n\\nIn effect, House Overlays reveal the areas of life of the house person that will be affected by the other’s presence (planets). But it begins with the perception of the planet person. It’s similar to entering someone’s actual home. When you enter someone’s home for the first time, you immediately perceive and form expectations based on the surrounding environment. Similarly, the planet person enters a birth chart house, and perceives you according to the environment of that specific house.\\n\\nSince House Overlays reveal perceptions and expectations regarding the partner, they can be used to pinpoint problems. Many relationship problems, separations, and divorces come about because of wrong perceptions about the partner, or lofty expectations. Partners should discuss what the House Overlays reveal, as it would bring them to a common understanding about each other’s expectations.\\n\\nIn addition, House Overlays can reveal why certain relationships never get off the ground.

Planets making harmonious aspects mean that those dimensions represented by each planet blend together with pleasing results. Planets making inharmonious (often called challenging or dynamic) aspects produce discordant, irritating and unpleasant results.\\n\\nFor example, a man’s Moon blending harmoniously (conjunct) with a woman’s Venus will make for a tender, emotional, sweet interaction between them (if the rest of the synastric analysis concurs). On the other hand, if his Moon makes a challenging aspect (square) to her Venus, then her way of projecting herself as a woman (Venus) will emotionally (Moon) irritate him instead of arousing tenderness.\\n\\nNow, there is always a mixture of harmonious and challenging synastry aspects between two charts. Don’t expect to find perfect synastry. That probably does not exist. We are simply looking for the positive aspects to be stronger than the negative aspects.

You should already know that aspects are relationships, measured in degrees of arc, between two planets in your birth chart. (An aspect can also take place between a planet and a special angle or point in your birth chart, i.e. Ascendant, M.C., I.C., Descendant, Lunar Nodes, and some other points.)\\n\\nTransits are, in effect, aspects between a planet’s current position up above and its position in your birth chart.\\n\\nThe positions of the planets at the moment you were born are captured on your birth chart. As you took your first breath, the planets continued on their tracks. As the planets continue moving, every once in a while, they come into aspect with the planetary positions on your birth chart.\\n\\nFor example, say you were born with the Sun at 16 ° and 28 minutes of Cancer, and Pluto at 24 ° of Libra. When Pluto moved into 16 degrees of Capricorn, in the year 2016, it made an opposition aspect (180 °) to your natal Sun.\\n\\nTo be clear, that aspect is called a “transit.” We would not call it an aspect because when we speak of aspects, we are usually speaking of natal aspects based on the positions of the planets at someone’s birth. An aspect made by a transiting planet is called a “transit” in astrology.\\n\\nA moving planet can stay in aspect anywhere from a few hours up to a few years. The moon, because she moves so fast, makes aspects only for a short hour or two. And then she’s gone. Neptune and Pluto, because they move so slowly (relative motion), can stay in aspect for 2 or 3 years. Use an orb of 1 degree to consider transits (but use a 2 degree orb to plan ahead!) While a moving planet is in aspect to a natal planetary position, the moving planet is said to be “transiting” the natal planet.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/What Are Transits In Astrology_ – Lesson 18.html'}, page_content='The transit has an influence over you during the entire time that it’s transiting, but it also has a point at which it becomes “exact.” This is the day when it reaches the exact degree, minute, and second of your birth planet. Some transits can become exact three times because of retrograde motion: the transiting planet passes over the point once, then the planet goes retrograde and backtracks over the point, then the planet goes back into direct motion and passes over the point a third time.\\n\\nIn the example above, Pluto would be transiting your natal Sun throughout most of 2016 because it will be close enough to 16 ° to be considered in aspect.

Technically, the planets are always in transit, as in “on the move.” But in astrology, “transit” is a term of art.

Aspects indicate how the various planetary and sign energies actually play out. They indicate, among other things, if there will be struggles or ease. Without acknowledging the aspects in a chart, the reading is incomplete, and ultimately incorrect. Keep this in mind when you begin to read the interpretations of your planets in the signs of your chart – the aspects tell more of the story.\\n\\nSo, what are aspects in astrology? Simply put, aspects are a connection or relationship between two or more planets. This connection always alters the interpretation of the planets and signs involved. When planets are in aspect to each other, their interpretations must be blended according to the nature of the aspect.\\n\\nTo be precise, aspects are special degrees of separation between the planets, with respect to the Earth. Since astrology focuses on the interplay between the celestial bodies and our Earth, we take a geocentric (Earth-centered) view of the heavens. The planets, then, are observed to orbit at different speeds in approximately the same plane in space.\\n\\nearth space astrology art\\n\\nAs a result of these planetary motions, various angles, measured in degrees, arc minutes, and arc seconds, are formed between the planets as seen from the Earth. In mathematics, an angle is defined as that fraction of a circle formed between two lines that intersect at the vertex. Imagine the Earth being at the center of the circle. Then imagine a line being drawn from two planets each to the Earth, so that the Earth is the vertex of the angle. The number of degrees between the two lines connecting two planets with respect to the Earth forms the angular relationship – the aspect – between the two planets. Aspects are considered not only for the planets, Sun, and Moon, but also for the points of the Ascendant and the Midheaven.\\n\\nExample of an Aspect\\n\\nastrology chart square aspect, labeled'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/Aspects and Orbs in Astrology – Lesson 9.html'}, page_content='Example of an Aspect\\n\\nastrology chart square aspect, labeled\\n\\nIn this example image, the Sun and the Moon are in \"square\" aspect. They are 90° apart, as you can see by the angle formed by the gray lines. However, astrologers do not label aspects like that, for that would be a tangled mess of lines in the birth chart. Instead, the angular relationships are denoted by a single line connecting the two planets in aspect. Thus, in any astrology chart, the square aspect will be denoted by a line like the red one in the image above.\\n\\nCertain degrees of angularity are very important in astrology. They are called the \"major aspects.\" The major aspects are 0° (conjunction), 60° (sextile), 90° (square), 120° (trine), and 180° (opposition).\\n\\nWhat Are Orbs?\\n\\nNow, aspects are given a margin in which they have an influence. For example, although the square aspect is 90°, two planets that are 95° (or 85°) apart are still considered to be in square aspect. This margin of influence is called an \"orb\" in astrology. In the example of 95°, it is considered a square aspect with an orb of 5°, since it deviates 5° from an exact square. An allowable orb is the amount by which the two planets involved can deviate from the exact number of degrees of the aspect and still be considered to have an aspect influence. Most astrologers use an allowable orb of only 6° for the major aspects, and 2° or 3° for the minor aspects. However, the allowable orb is increased to 10° (or 8°) if it includes the Sun or Moon. This is a matter of preference, but in fact, the smaller the orb, the more significant the aspect is, with orbs of less than 1° being the most potent aspect influences.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/Aspects and Orbs in Astrology – Lesson 9.html'}, page_content=\"As you'll see below, each aspect can be defined as a circle divided by a number. A full circle is 360°. However, to avoid confusion, notice that the astrology chart is divided into 12 signs of 30° each. Then the square aspect (90°) will be between planets that are in the same degree, but three signs apart. The sextile will be two signs apart, the trine will be four signs apart, and the opposition will be six signs apart.\\n\\nMany pages can be written describing the dynamics of each aspect, but here we will brief. Keep in mind that as you grow in your knowledge of astrology, and as you gain experience in interpreting charts, you can add your own insight into how the aspects are manifested.\\n\\nMajor Aspects\\n\\nConjunction ()\\n\\ndiagram of conjunction astrology aspect, 0 degrees\\n\\nThe conjunction (0°) is the circle divided by one (in which the conjunction can be termed as 360° apart, which is the same as 0° in a circle). This is a very dynamic aspect, since it marks a strong focalized potential for expression along with a tendency for direct action and self-dramatization. The two planets in conjunction are blended together, fused, and intensified. Planets in conjunction must be interpreted as a blend in which the planets work together. This can be a good thing if the two planets get along (like say, Venus and the Moon), but it can be inharmonious if the two planets are incompatible (like say, Mars and Neptune).\\n\\nSextile (\\n\\nsextile astrology aspect, glyph symbol\\n\\nDiagram of sextile astrology aspect\\n\\nThe sextile aspect (60°) is the circle divided by six. It represents an easy flow of opportunities or ideas that, if acted upon, will help realize the individual's goals. It can also indicate talents. This is a harmonious aspect in which the energies of the planets involved collaborate well and work comfortably together. However, while this is traditionally a positive aspect, it is not dynamic. This aspect is rather passive, and it does not necessarily bring an impetus to do anything. The sextile aspect can be characterized as a lack of friction. The main reason that it’s considered positive is that it will not disrupt anything. This is usually pleasant, but can sometimes go unnoticed.\\n\\nSquare ()\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/Aspects and Orbs in Astrology – Lesson 9.html'}, page_content=\"Square ()\\n\\nThe square (90°) is the circle divided by four. This aspect implies restrictions and challenges. It is a dynamic aspect since the challenges pressure you to work on the issues represented by the planets involved. Planets in square aspect are at cross-purposes. They are in conflict that leads to irritation; achievement is delayed, though patient hard work can lead to success through integration of the two principles. Traditionally, this is a negative, inharmonious aspect. The planets and houses involved are areas in the individual's life where adjustments must be made and where tremendous effort must be expended to realize gains.\\n\\nTrine ()\\n\\ndiagram of trine astrology aspect\\n\\nThe trine (120°) is the circle divided by three. This is considered the most fortunate of aspects. The trine aspect represents easy flowing energy between the planets involved, bringing luck, opportunities, and innate creative talents. But even too much of a good thing can be bad – the ease brought on by the trine can sometimes be taken for granted, and the talents left unexpressed. In the ancient days, this aspect was thought to bring about a laziness (due to all the good luck) that was considered evil. But more often than not, the trine aspect tends to manifest the most pleasant potential of the planets involved.\\n\\nOpposition ()\\n\\nThe opposition (180°) is the circle divided by two. Planets in opposition will appear directly across from each other in the birth chart. This aspect indicates a fundamental polarity or duality; a situation in which one must cooperate with others or break with them. It creates tension leading to frustration, though objectivity can lead to a delicate balancing of opposites. Resolving the tension is helped by compromising between the two energies, otherwise they bounce back and forth, competing for center stage in your life. Compromise can be achieved by accepting that the two are parts of a whole. In general, this is considered an inharmonious aspect.\\n\\nMinor Aspects\\n\\nSemi-sextile (\\n\\nsemi-sextile astrology aspect glyph symbol\"),\n",

This aspect is very mild, barely noticeable, almost insignificant. It is considered by some astrologers as mildly beneficial, but since it connects signs of different elements and qualities, it may actually be mildly difficult, awkward, or uncomfortable. This aspect should be interpreted by taking into account the rest of the chart for more insight. This minor aspect will usually corroborate with other things specified in the chart.\\n\\nSemi-square ()\\n\\nThe semi-square (45°) is the circle divided by 8.

This aspect demands continual adjustments. It is not necessarily negative, but it brings strain, some difficulty, or stress. This can sometimes affect the health. It can indicate circumstances that are forced upon the person, or self-neglect regarding that area of life.\\n\\nQuintile ()\\n\\nThe quintile (72°) is the circle divided by five. Quintiles imply artistic or creative talents, especially mental ones, as well as versatility and an authentic individuality. It is considered mildly beneficial. The biquintile (144°, ) is considered in the same way as the quintile.\\n\\nThe Cosmolabe Was Used To Measure Aspects\\n\\nPeople in history measured the aspects using a cosmolabe.

And so you pay careful attention to that clock, because that clock will show you when it’s time to go home from work. But the clock never forced you to leave work, neither did it ever seal your fate.

The ten planets of astrology are: Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto[1]. (From our geocentric position, Earth is not included in the list; however Earth\\'s interplay in the scheme of things is denoted by the Ascendant.) However, before the 18th century only the first seven planets were recognized (they were perceivable to the naked eye): Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Since over 2,000 years ago, the seven classical planets were observed to keep time, orbiting steadily on their paths. Perhaps that is why the number seven was symbolic of deity in ancient cultures. The seven were named after Greek gods because their influence was considered to be as such. Seven was the number of days chosen for a week, with each day borrowing its name from one of the classical planets. (The days making up our calendar month were determined based on one complete cycle through the 12 zodiac signs by the moon, from which the word \"month\" comes from.)\\n\\nThe discoveries of Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto corresponded to revolutionary changes in our world, from the Industrial Revolution and discovery of electricity (Uranus), to the financial collapse and interest in world domination of the 1930’s (Pluto). Pluto’s demotion of status to a “dwarf planet” does not change the fact that it is a celestial body participating in the continuous flow of energy in our world. Thus, Pluto is included here as a planet. (Astrology also observes several other asteroids/planetoids, regardless of planetary status. The body is there, thus, it counts.)\\n\\nEach planet symbolizes a different component of life, a different type of energy. In psychological terms, we can call them “needs” or “drives.” Click on the astrology planets above to learn what each one brings to astrology.\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n1.

If you prefer, see Synastry Interpretations instead.)\\n\\nWhat is synastry? Synastry is the art and science of comparing two birth charts to ascertain the energy flow between two individuals. Synastry is the astrology of relationships, and it reveals the level of compatibility between two people. Please don\\'t confuse this with fortune-telling. Synastry will not tell you if you are \"fated to be together.\" Any two people can choose to be together. Synastry shows if two unique individuals can be themselves and blend nicely together, or if being themselves causes the irritating grinding of mismatched gears.\\n\\nSpecifically, 3 things are compared:\\n\\nElements – At the very least, the dominant element in each chart must flow smoothly with the other.\\n\\nHouse Overlays – \"How you perceive each other.\" This is literally laying one birth chart over the other one, aligning them by zodiac sign degrees. First we note in which of your 12 Houses your partner\\'s planets fall. Then we note in which of your partner\\'s 12 Houses your planets fall.\\n\\nSynastry Aspects (also called Inter-aspects) – These are aspects formed from planets and angles in one chart to the planets and angles in the second chart. Here is the \"nitty gritty\" of a relationship. The dynamics between you is revealed by synastry aspects.\\n\\nNothing so profoundly affects our lives as contact with others, so this subject should be entered into with compassion and a commitment to thoroughness. If you rush the process of synastry, you will make erroneous judgments about something so serious. It is too easy and common for people to compare just 1 or 2 synastry aspects and assume they have the entire relationship mapped out. This is usually a huge mistake. Do not bother with synastry if you will not take the time to consider all parts. A real relationship is always at stake.\\n\\nThe scientific part of synastry is that all aspects, house cusps, planets, points, and angles are calculated mathematically. In this sense, synastry (and all astrology) is mathematically precise. Allowable orbs for synastry aspects range according to the preference of the astrologer. Keep in mind, we exist in a universal energy field in which an energy influence increases as it comes near us or decreases as it departs. It doesn’t just appear or disappear. So we must be flexible with allowable orbs.\\n\\nThen the art of synastry is to paint a picture of this energy field that is erected between the two birth charts. Please don\\'t attempt to do this without some intermediate astrological knowledge. Especially regarding your own relationships! 99% of the time, you will not be objective regarding your own relationship synastry unless you are experienced in astrology. Take time and learn as much as you can before making judgment calls regarding relationships.\\n\\nRelated\\n\\nSynastry Interpretations\\n\\nLove & Relationship Articles\\n\\nCite This Page\\n\\nMLA style\\n\\nCorinne Lane. \"Synastry Art and Science- Synastry Aspects, Element Compatibility, House Overlays\" Astrolibrary.

The Rising sign is interchangeably called the Ascendant. It can be located on a natal chart as the sign on which the 1st House cusp falls. It is the sign that was at the eastern horizon point, from the viewpoint of your birth coordinates, at the moment of your birth. It rises on the path of the sun’s rise, and it changes degrees every few minutes. This is why an accurate birth time and place is so important for an accurate horoscope. A Rising sign can be different for twins born just a couple minutes apart. Further, this Ascendant point is the premises for the calculations of the rest of the house cusps. A few minutes of time difference shifts the entire chart.\\n\\nAstrology rising stars and sun, Classic Astrology Art\\n\\nThe Rising sign is like a direct connection between our Earth and the zodiac path. It is the zodiac sign that was “rising” over the Earth at the moment that we took our first breath, the point of intersection between the wheel of personal Houses and the celestial zodiac wheel. It represents our appearance in the world. The Rising sign is the image we project, the impression we make on others, the way we take action in the world, and the lasting effect we have on the environment. The Rising sign is often described as a public mask that we wear, since it tends to be how people see us, especially strangers who don’t know our deeper selves. But in fact, the Rising sign is not like a mask because wearing a mask denotes some level of falsity or hiding oneself. Your Rising Sign characteristics are not a \"fake cover-up\" as a mask would imply. Those characteristics are a real and true part of who your are, more like a face than a mask. Even though your face is shallow and external, you\\'re stuck with it and cannot take it off! It\\'s a real part of you, not fake. And people usually perceive it in ways that you yourself do not. That\\'s a Rising Sign for you – others see you as the embodiment of those characteristics, even though you might not see yourself like that.\\n\\nYour Sun sign is your true self, but it’s like the frame of a car, which is not so visible underneath the doors, bumpers and shiny paint. The Rising sign is how people perceive us because it is the style that we use to go about meeting the needs of our Sun sign. For example, a Capricorn-Sun person is ambitious, reserved, and needs order. But coupled with a Sagittarius-Rising sign, the person will appear care-free and un-ambitious, while all the time working hard to reach its Capricornian goals.\\n\\nWe tend to behave more like our Rising sign when we are surrounded by strangers, or in new situations, like job interviews. But still, it tends to be our personal style at all times. Personal style does not represent our deepest needs, though (like the Moon). A study of the Rising sign is best used as a tool to understand why people behave the way they do. The Rising sign is also said to describe our physical characteristics – our looks. For example, Libra-Rising is beautiful, Pisces-Rising has a dreamy appearance and small feet, Taurus-Rising is stocky with a thick neck, and so forth. We find this to be somewhat accurate most of the time. You try it and see.\\n\\nThe Rising sign is extremely important in the natal chart. The planet that rules the Rising sign is considered to be the chart ruler (planetary rulerships will be discussed in a later lesson). In practical terms, this means that every planet and sign in your natal chart is filtered through the Rising sign, or filtered through its ruling planet. Here is the most literal reason why we see people of the same Sun sign who behave so differently. They must obviously have different Rising signs.\\n\\nIn addition, people with the same Rising sign can also have different personalities because of the following: since the Rising sign is not as as basically fundamental as our Sun sign, it is greatly subject to the modifying influence of aspects. In other words, you don\\'t have a clear description of your Rising sign until you\\'ve blended in the energies of any planets aspecting the Ascendant. Example: A person with Leo Rising, but with Saturn in conjunction with the Ascendant will not be as bubbly and expressive as a typical \"Leo Rising\" person.\\n\\nSome astrologers believe that the Rising sign is the way the world forces you to behave. At some point in your youth, you were forced or taught to behave like your Rising sign. You can trace the Rising sign to one of your parents or primary care givers. Many times, the Rising sign of child will match the dominant sign of one of the parents.\\n\\nNow that you know what a rising sign is, see the Rising Sign Interpretations.\\n\\nFind out your rising sign with our Rising Sign Calculator\\n\\nCite This Page\\n\\nMLA style\\n\\nCorinne Lane. \"What is a Rising Sign/Ascendant – Astrology Lesson 6\" Astrolibrary.

If you prefer, see instead 4 Easy Birth Chart Reading Techniques For Beginners.)\\n\\n(Get your free birth chart and report here.)\\n\\nThe most important thing to remember while interpreting any birth chart is: synthesis. The entire chart must be taken as a whole. A natal chart abounds with bits and pieces of information about an individual. Each separate bit must be synthesized into one whole picture of the person.\\n\\nThis means that you cannot take one piece of the chart (for example, Mercury in Sagittarius) and decide that it defines the entire person. If you do that, you will, undoubtedly, be in error. Of course, you will be tempted to stop at one or another of the planetary meanings, and think that it is the defining factor of a person. This is a big mistake. For example, say that two individuals both have Mercury in Sagittarius (denoting something of a \"big mouth\"). You may be tempted to assume that both of the individuals are \"outspoken.\" But, say the first person has the Sun in Capricorn, while the second person has the Sun in Sagittarius. While they both have Mercury in Sagittarius, the first person (Sun in Capricorn) will have a much more reserved communication style than the second person (Sun in Sagittarius).\\n\\nThe point, again (and this point will be repeated often), is that the entire chart must be blended together. Yes, by all means, go ahead and see all the separate interpretations of each planet in its sign and house. But then you must weave it all together, and lace it with the Rising Sign, to get an accurate picture.\\n\\nIt’s as if each of us is a mosaic, made up of tiny individual images. In the birth chart, each separate planet in a sign and house is like one tiny individual image, one tiny part of the whole mosaic. Now, two different completed mosaics, if you look close enough, may contain tiny pieces that are exactly the same, yet they are part of two completely different finished mosaics (this point is illustrated by the example of Mercury in Sagittarius above). Although the mosaics contain similar pieces, the final products look nothing alike. So what we’re saying here is the opposite of that age-old adage: \"Don\\'t judge a book by its cover.\" The opposite is \"Don’t judge a book by a single page inside.\" The work of the astrologer, then, is to take all the bits and pieces of insight in the birth chart and synthesize them into a whole. What emerges is an amazingly accurate portrait of an individual.\\n\\nInterpreting Planets in the Signs\\n\\nLook at the birth chart and take note of what sign and house each planet is in. (Check here if you need help remembering what the symbols/glyphs mean.) Here is a handy, printable worksheet that will help you keep track of your birth chart information. Also take note of the Ascendant\\'s sign (Rising Sign), and which house the Ascendant\\'s ruler occupies.\\n\\nNow you can look up the \"Chart Interpretations\" of each of your planets and Rising Sign. The Chart Interpretations on the linked page are only general meanings of what each item represents. As you get a feel for the basic energy of each planet, and of the qualities of each sign, you can add your own insight.\\n\\nThe zodiac sign will show how the planet is manifested. Previously, we likened the signs to \"stained-glass windows\" through which the planet is expressed. See if this analogy helps: envision a sentence, with a \"verb\" and an \"adverb.\" The planet is the \"verb\" while the zodiac sign is the \"adverb.\" For example, the Moon (feel, nurture, respond) in the sign of Capricorn (reservedly, coldly) denotes someone who nurtures in a cold and reserved way, or has trouble expressing emotions. That\\'s not a happy placement for the Moon, but remember: there\\'s more to the story…the rest of the chart. (See what each planet means in Lesson 5: The Planets. See what each zodiac sign means in Lesson 8: Zodiac Signs)\\n\\nIncorporating the Astrological Houses\\n\\nThe other thing to remember is that the planet in the sign will focus on the House. This means that the activity denoted by the planet will take place in the arena of your life designated by the House in which that planet falls. (Remember, each House represents a sphere of life – i.e. work, home, friendships, etc.) The planet is the \"what,\" the sign is \"how\" that \"what\" is done, and the House is \"where\" it takes place. Here is a handy reminder to use when interpreting your natal chart:\\n\\nPlanets = What? Signs = How? Houses = Where?\\n\\nThe following table explains it further.\\n\\nPlanets = “What” = energies; what you like to do Signs = “How” = the way you do it Houses = “Where” = areas of your life\\n\\nAn example of why taking the House into consideration is so important:\\n\\nSay a person has Saturn in Capricorn in the 7th House, which could manifest as a reserved (Capricorn) attitude in love relationships (7th House). Then, say this same individual has Venus in Sagittarius in the 11th House. This person will be friendly and outgoing (Sagittarius) in social situations and groups (11th House), but unemotional and detached (although dependable) in love relationships (Saturn in Capricorn in the 7th). (Astrology is a powerful tool for understanding those seemingly contradicting tendencies that we all have. The birth chart tells it all. With time and patience, you will be able to read all such details from a birth chart)\\n\\nHouse Rulers (Signs on the Cusps)\\n\\nAnother influence on each House (in each department of life) is the ruling planet of the House. The ruling planet of each House in your natal chart is the planet that rules the sign on the cusp. For example, if you have Capricorn on the 7th House cusp, then Saturn is the Ruler of your 7th House, because Saturn rules Capricorn. The result is that Saturn will have an influence in the matters of your 7th House, regardless of which House Saturn is actually residing in. (Here is a table of the Sign Rulerships). The sign on each house cusp shows one\\'s attitude towards the matters of that house, whereas planets in the house show actual circumstances. For example, Capricorn on the 7th House cusp denotes an attitude of reserve or caution towards forming partnerships. On the other hand, Saturn in the 7th house may denote actual problems transpiring in partnerships and in marriage. These are subtle differences that will perfect your interpretations when reading a birth chart.\\n\\nSo a House is influenced by any planets residing in that House, but also by the ruler of the House. Most of the time, the ruler will be in a different House. Many times, the goods of the House will be used for advantage in the House where the planetary ruler actually resides. For example, say you have Capricorn on the 7th House cusp, and Saturn (Capricorn\\'s ruler) in the 2nd House. You may very well choose to marry (7th House) for money (ruler in 2nd House). This last statement brings us to our next point – a word of caution.\\n\\nA Word of Caution\\n\\nThe celestial configuration that took place at your moment of birth is a powerful indicator of your motivations, drives, preferences, and psychological makeup, but it does not seal your fate. It does show the potential you were born with, but what you do with that potential is up to you.\\n\\nSome astrologers mistakenly interpret birth charts by declaring the outcomes of the drives, or the external circumstances. They declare things that must definitively take place. But the correct way to interpret a birth chart is to declare the drives, strengths, weaknesses, preferences, needs, tendencies, and so forth. Astrology reveals our inner psychological makeup. The outcomes are for the individual to manifest for him/herself. For example, above it was mentioned that if you have Capricorn ruling your 7th House, and Saturn in the 2nd House, then you might marry for money. But the proper way to read that example is to declare that you \"have a need for security in your relationships. You have a need for security, but it does not necessarily mean that you will marry for money. You may very well choose to marry a pauper for true love. But be assured that your need for material security in relationships (as shown in your birth chart) will continue as a nagging feeling you won\\'t easily be rid of.\"\\n\\nThe natal chart never lies. The problem is when the natal chart is read incorrectly. Remember, instead of giving predestined predictions, you will be more precise to explain the potential. People choose what to do with their potential. As Henley wrote,\\n\\nI am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul.\"\\n\\nThe natal chart is one\\'s map.\\n\\nHere is another example, taken from history. Ancient astrologers, before psychology was popular, interpreted charts in a more fatalistic manner. If you were a Pisces, they would say that you would end up living in poverty (the \"starving artist\" stereotype) because you were such a \"weakling\". Modern astrologers understand the deeper psychological drives and needs that are represented by the planets and signs. Nowadays, we understand that Pisces has a need to transcend the mundane, and while he is very artistic, he is not fated to live in poverty. Pisces simply does not prioritize money or materials. He could be poor, or he could be rich. Either way, the Pisces will prioritize the intangible over the tangible – which is how we interpret it today. The interpretation shifted from a predetermined fate (poverty), to a psychological drive (need for artistic/spiritual transcendence) that may result in any circumstantial fate.\\n\\nRemembering Aspects\\n\\nDon\\'t forget the aspects. If you attempt to make an interpretation without considering the aspects, you will be in error. Interpretations for each planet in sign and house must be modified according to the nature of the aspects. Aspects can soften things and bring ease to otherwise troublesome planetary placements, or they can bring conflict to otherwise pleasant planetary placements. Aspects stimulate the planets.\\n\\nEvery planet has both easy and difficult (or positive and negative) manifestations. For example, the sun\\'s energy can be expressed as a generous pouring forth of self and creativity, or prideful arrogance and an excessive desire to be special. Aspects from other planets tell whether the energies will be expressed easily and positively (if it receives trines & sextiles), or with struggle and conflict (if it receives squares or oppositions). Again, a birth chart interpretation without accounting for aspects is incorrect, or at least incomplete. (See Lesson 9: Aspects in Astrology)\\n\\nMost important aspects to look for:\\n\\nTake immediate notice of conjunctions to any of the four angles (this means conjunctions to the Ascendant, M.C., Descendant, I.C.). When a planet makes a conjunction to one of the angles, the influence of that planet may be the strongest influence in the chart. The person will identify very strongly with the traits of that planet. This is explained in detail in: The Meaning of a Planet in Conjunction To 1 of Your Angles.\\n\\nAlso take notice of conjunctions made by the outer planets (Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto) to the inner planets (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, and Mars). These conjunctions will drastically alter the interpretation for the inner planet by adding its own qualities. A conjunction from Uranus adds rebelliousness and innovation; a conjunction from Neptune adds confusion or sadness and/or inspiration and magic, and a conjunction from Pluto adds power, but can be a bit creepy.\\n\\nFor example, a Leo-Sun person who has Pluto making a conjunction aspect with their Sun will be very Plutonian. This person would be one of the most silent and secretive Leos ever.\\n\\nBalance of Elements and Qualities\\n\\nAnother thing to note is the balance of elements and qualities in the chart. If you feel overwhelmed with all this new information, then you should simply try this step first. This is the easiest interpretation that can be derived from a natal chart, even for inexperienced people. This is how it\\'s done:\\n\\nNote the element of the sign of each planet, and that of the ascendant, and of the midheaven. This printable worksheet will help you. Then simply count how many are fire, air, Earth, and water. Count the Sun\\'s and the Moon\\'s element for 2 each, because they are such a strong influence. It\\'s common to have a combination of elements, say 3 or 4 of each. However, should you find an imbalance, such as 5 or more of an element, or 0 to 1 of an element, this will say something about the overall temperament of the individual. Five or more of one element will make that the \"Predominant Element\" in the individual. It is interesting to note that the Predominant Element may be different from that of the Sun sign. In this case, the person will behave even less like their Sun sign – yet another reason why we cannot define a person simply by their Sun sign. If a chart is completely lacking in an element, or if there is only 1 planet in an element, that will be considered the \"Weakest Element.\" The \"General Interpretations\" on the following page will include interpretations for Predominant and Weakest Elements.\\n\\nThe same method is used to tally up the balance of qualities (Cardinal, Fixed, Mutable) of each planet, ascendant, and midheaven. This gives only subtle information, unless you find a great imbalance, such as a complete lack of one quality, or 6 or more of one quality. This printable worksheet will help you.\\n\\nIf you have your worksheet filled in with all the signs and houses of your planets, continue to Chart Interpretations to help you interpret your own birth chart.\\n\\nCite This Page\\n\\nMLA style\\n\\nCorinne Lane. \"How to Read Your Own Birth Chart – Astrology Lesson 10\" Astrolibrary.

This introduction explains why relationship astrology is reliable for finding genuine happiness in love.\\n\\nFor starters, we each have different preferences and different needs. Mainstream relationship advice, whether it comes from psychologists, books, or other media, is extremely limited in its capacity to be effective simply because they all ignore that one precious fact: each human is unique, with different preferences and different needs.\\n\\nThere is not one universal definition of a good relationship or lover. Ladies, it’s a waste of time to try and fit the mold of the popular media’s definition of a great girlfriend because that definition may not attract the man that satisfies you. Men, it’s a waste of time to follow rigid dating tips that may not appeal to the woman of your dreams.\\n\\nSo how do know what attracts or appeals to the lover of your dreams? More importantly, what attracts or appeals to you? What type of man/woman is the lover of your dreams? What do you need in a lover, in a relationship, in a spouse? You may think you know the answer to these questions. However, popular media may be influencing you to seek qualities that are not your natural preferences.\\n\\nThat ultimately results in failed relationships.\\n\\nOn the other hand, relationship astrology reveals your legitimate preferences. It is surprisingly thorough at detailing all the little things that we love and hate in relationships. Astrology is an extremely effective tool for illuminating each individual’s preferences and needs, including your hidden subconscious desires. Astrology reveals your psychological makeup and your hidden drives.\\n\\nYou can test this out by reading the description of your own Venus sign: Venus in the Signs. (Note that the description of your Venus sign will be an incomplete picture of your love style because a complete description must include aspects and other astrological factors.)\\n\\nThe benefit of astrology is that it reveals your unique and true love styles, love needs, and love preferences.\\n\\nWhy is this important?\\n\\nWhen you awaken your deeply-embedded love style, you awaken the love energy that can attract a naturally compatible lover. Relationships between naturally compatible people invite happiness and genuine satisfaction into our lives.\\n\\nSagittarius Couple Holding Hands on Swing Set\\n\\nRelated\\n\\nSynastry Interpretations\\n\\nLove & Relationship Articles\\n\\nCite This Page\\n\\nMLA style\\n\\nCorinne Lane. \"Relationship Astrology – Introduction\" Astrolibrary.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/Zodiac Signs – Astrology Lesson 8 _ AstroLibrary.html'}, page_content='Astrolibrary logo\\n\\nAstroLibrary 🔎\\n\\nDaily Personalized Horoscope ↗\\n\\nZodiac Signs – Astrology Lesson 8\\n\\n(This page is a lesson about zodiac signs. You can instead go to zodiac sign descriptions. Or, for just the dates of the zodiac signs, see below.)\\n\\nWhat are the zodiac signs? The ancient Babylonians created the zodiac wheel by first splitting our sky into four sections designated by the yearly equinoxes and solstices (the turning points of the four yearly seasons).\\n\\nEach of these four sections of sky were split into 3 sections measuring 30 degrees each. This gives us a full 360-degree zodiac circle with 12 equal sections of 30 degrees each. Each 30-degree section is one zodiac sign, for a total of 12 zodiac signs (12, not 13). These 12 zodiac signs are not star constellations. The zodiac signs are 30-degree sections of space that were mathematically calculated in a way that was, and still is, intimately connected to our yearly seasons. (A Short History of Astrology)\\n\\nThe zodiac circle always assigns zero degrees of Aries (Aries, the zodiac sign, not the star constellation) to the Vernal Equinox (the Spring Equinox, or the first day of Spring in the northern hemisphere).\\n\\nThis zodiac wheel, also known as the tropical zodiac or western zodiac, is still accurate because we always align/begin it, as the ancients Greeks did, with the first day of Spring. This not a mistake. The zodiac wheel is intimately aligned with our Earth’s seasons. (This is an important fact to recognize. Some people today fail to recognize this fact, and so they erroneously claim that the zodiac wheel is misaligned. They do not understand that the Earth’s axial precession, or “precession of the equinoxes” does not impair the zodiac wheel.)\\n\\nThe ancient Babylonians used the constellations that appeared in the general area of each zodiac sign as placeholders. They designated 12 constellations to represent the 12 zodiac signs in the sky. The star constellations, with their varying degrees and sizes, are not the actual zodiac signs. These constellations were named after the zodiac signs they represent, not the other way around!\\n\\nZodiac signs wheel with sun in center. Ancient astrology art.\\n\\nThere were no cute animals or mythical creatures associated with them yet. Different energies were observed to correlate with the position of the planets in different sections of the heavens. These 12 signs became 12 different archetypes, each with their own characteristics.\\n\\n(Notice how the 12 archetypes recur in history: 12 Gods of Olympus, 12 sons of Abraham, 12 tribes of Israel, 12 Apostles of Jesus Christ, 12 Successors to the Prophet Muhammad).\\n\\nThe 12 archetypes, or zodiac signs, already had their traits before the ancient Greeks attached the popular symbols to them. The Greeks had the uncanny brilliance of choosing symbols that parallel the sign traits very closely. So now, when we think of the sign of Aries, we think of a ram; when we think of Sagittarius, we think of an archer, and so on. This lesson will not delve into the mythological stories behind the choice of symbols for the signs. We will give a topical, general description of the archetype of each sign.\\n\\nTo clarify, the following descriptions of the zodiac signs refer to the archetype of the sign itself, regardless of which planet is in the sign. We will describe the zodiac sign as if it were a person, with characteristics. In other words, the following descriptions do not specifically or exclusively apply to people with the Sun in that sign. This is because the Sun sign is not the only defining characteristic of a person. While the Sun sign is important, it is by no means the complete story of our personal profile.\\n\\nlight shining through stained glass window\\n\\nOur Moon sign, Rising sign, Mercury sign, Venus sign, and all the rest are just as important in giving us a complete picture of ourselves. We all have the entire zodiac in our charts – all 12 zodiac signs. For this reason, it is important to learn the traits of all the signs. Planets in the signs will be expressed according to the traits of the sign they are in. Thus, the zodiac signs modify the planets. Each zodiac sign is like a stained-glass window through which the planets must pass to manifest in our lives. Each \"window\" is different. And different planets through the same \"window\" will also be different. (For example, the Sun in Aries is not the same as the Moon in Aries).\\n\\nClick on each zodiac sign constellation to learn about it.\\n\\nAries Taurus Gemini Cancer\\n\\nLeo Virgo Libra Scorpio\\n\\nSagittarius Capricorn Aquarius Pisces\\n\\n* Sun Sign Dates\\n\\nNote: Being born on the cusp does not mean you have two sun signs.\\n\\nHere are the approximate dates for Zodiac Sun Signs:\\n\\nAries:\\n\\nMarch 20 – April 22 approximately\\n\\nTaurus:\\n\\nApril 19 – May 22 approximately\\n\\nGemini:\\n\\nMay 20 – June 22 approximately\\n\\nCancer:\\n\\nJune 20 – July 22 approximately\\n\\nLeo:\\n\\nJuly 21 – August 22 approximately\\n\\nVirgo:\\n\\nAugust 21 – September 22 approximately\\n\\nLibra:\\n\\nSeptember 21 – October 22 approximately\\n\\nScorpio:\\n\\nOctober 21 – November 22 approximately\\n\\nSagittarius:\\n\\nNovember 21 – December 22 approximately\\n\\nCapricorn:\\n\\nDecember 20 – January 22 approximately\\n\\nAquarius:\\n\\nJanuary 19 – February 20 approximately\\n\\nPisces:\\n\\nFebruary 17 – March 21 approximately\\n\\nCite This Page\\n\\nMLA style\\n\\nCorinne Lane. \"Zodiac Signs – Astrology Lesson 8\" Astrolibrary.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/Before Determining Compatibility – Individual Capacity to Relate.html'}, page_content='Astrolibrary logo\\n\\nAstroLibrary 🔎\\n\\nDaily Personalized Horoscope ↗\\n\\nBefore Determining Compatibility – Individual Capacity to Relate\\n\\n(This is a compatibility lesson. If you prefer, see zodiac compatibility instead, or the synastry interpretations.)\\n\\nBefore attempting to determine compatibility between 2 people, check each birth chart separately to determine what each individual’s capacity to relate is? How well matched are their needs for intimacy? How well do the individual life goals, styles, and rhythms blend? If their life goals don’t match up well, all the compatibility in the world will not help such star-crossed lovers.\\n\\nAnswer the 4 following questions:\\n\\nHow comfortable is each with their biologic role and how well do these roles match up? How well does each relate to their own and the opposite sex? Those at ease with the opposite sex will be frustrated when trying to form a relationship with someone who is not. Do not assume that others function the same as you do, as that will plant the seeds of friction and annoyance when you find that they do not. Look at the aspects of the Sun, Moon, Venus and Mars in the birth chart. Then check your aspects in the following 3 tables to see what those aspects signify.\\n\\nDo you Play Well with Males?\\n\\nLook at Sun\\'s Aspects\\n\\nif Sun has several good aspects; no squares or oppositions of Sun\\n\\nGenerally at ease & comfortable with males, and comfortable playing society\\'s expected role towards males\\n\\nif Sun is unaspected, or only lightly aspected\\n\\nMales will not play a significant role in one\\'s life\\n\\nif Sun has hard aspects (squares or oppositions)\\n\\nRelating to males (whether father, friend, or lover) is stressful & anxious; has difficulty accepting society\\'s demands in relating to males\\n\\ncompatibility with males, father, son, grandfather\\n\\nrelationship compatibility with females\\n\\nDo you Play Well with Females?\\n\\nLook at Moon\\'s Aspects\\n\\nif Moon makes harmonious aspects – conjunctions, trines and sextiles\\n\\nRelates easily and happily to females\\n\\nif Moon makes no, or minimal, aspects\\n\\nInteraction with females is generally unimportant, routine, or obligatory\\n\\nif Moon makes hard aspects\\n\\nFinds female qualities irritating or demanding (either in themselves or others)\\n\\nCan you be Happy in Love and Sex?\\n\\nif Venus has good aspects; no squares or oppositions\\n\\nHappy capacity to give of self, find beauty & value in others, and act to communicate those feelings\\n\\nif Venus has hard aspects\\n\\nLimited ability to express love; limited ability to develop trust & admiration for another person enough for a love commitment\\n\\nif Mars is well-aspected\\n\\nCommunicates sexual needs openly & gracefully\\n\\nif Mars is badly-aspected\\n\\nstressful or discordant sexual style\\n\\nHow well do the life goals, limitations, and unconscious needs of each match up? Where do they find satisfaction, fulfillment, limitations, frustrations, and illusions? If these are not well matched, no amount of love, sexual attraction, worldly success or effort will prevail against a simple mismatch of what each person defines as a good and satisfactory life. Look at the Houses in the birth chart containing the Moon, Venus, Saturn, and Neptune…\\n\\nWhat is \"The Good Life\" to you?\\n\\nLook at Houses of Moon & Venus\\n\\nThe Houses containing the Moon and Venus show what areas of life provide you with a sense of emotional fulfillment and joy of living (especially the Moon\\'s house). If these houses clash with those of your partner, conflict down the line will be inevitable regardless of how compatible your personalities are. A person\\'s life goals are almost always (I dare say, always) related to one of these houses. These houses signify those things you want to do when you retire, or when you win the lottery. Would you prefer to go sky-diving or snuggle up with a book? Travel the world, or be a cookie-baking grandparent?\\n\\nSome brief examples: A person with Moon in the 5th house may get a sense of well-being from the pursuit of pleasure and thrill-seeking adventures. Moon or Venus in the 4th house prefers to sit at home. Moon or Venus in the 7th house needs to be in a one-to-one relationship, but in the 11th house large community groups are preferred. Moon or Venus in the 12th is comfortable in solitude and may forego partnerships altogether. 10th or 6th house: needs to be productive instead of relaxing and thrill seeking; likely a workaholic. But in the 10th house, public worldly success is a must, while in the 6th enjoyment comes simply from a job well-done, working behind the scenes.\\n\\nExamine the Houses containing the Moon and Venus in both charts to see if the individuals can possibly enjoy life together.\\n\\nSee descriptions of all 12 Houses See interpretations for Moon in the Houses See interpretations for Venus in the Houses\\n\\nWhere are you Frustrated or Limited?\\n\\nLook at House of Saturn\\n\\nThe House containing Saturn is the most frustrating area of life for the individual. There exists ambivalence regarding this house: you want the stuff of this house, yet at the same time, you don\\'t want it. There seems to be built-in limitations in this area of life. What is frustrating for the individual will eventually carry over into any relationship. Couples beware of your partner\\'s house of Saturn! Limitations can be overcome, but not without struggle, as this house is sure to teach. Can you accept your partner’s Saturn? More about Saturn in the Houses.\\n\\nWhere are you Disappointed? Fall for Illusions?\\n\\nLook at House of Neptune\\n\\nThe House containing Neptune is the area of life that is always just out of reach. This is the sphere of life that will seemingly forever elude us in finding completeness. Yet, in this house, we endlessly chase illusions and fulfillments. We have big dreams for this house, but only limited success. Couples beware of your expectations regarding your partner\\'s Neptune house! No doubt, this is the most inspired and inspiring house in the birth chart, the only one where fantasy can become real, but here…what you see is not always what you get. Dreams can come true in your Neptune house (Oprah has Neptune in her House of Career), but more often than not, Neptune leaves us swimming in a deep pool of delusion and fantasy. Can you swim in your partner’s Neptune house? Better yet, have you got room in your boat? More about Neptune in the Houses.\\n\\nWhat’s your Love Language?\\n\\nWhat type of relating energy exists in each chart? Sexual energy? Emotional energy? Companionability? Permanence? These can be seen as relating \"languages.\" Understanding the partner\\'s love language can help avoid feelings of rejection. For example, if one partner naturally pours much emotionally and/or physically into the relationship, but the other is, by nature, much less emotionally or sexually energetic, this can be misinterpreted as disinterest or lack of commitment to the relationship. We really only understand love in our own \"love language.\" If your partner speaks fire and you speak water, you will both feel like you don\\'t love each other. Loving someone in that scenario will require a lot of work. And unfortunately, you will not easily appreciate the effort because it will usually be in a language foreign to your heart.\\n\\nA different way of understanding these energy levels is to see them like radio frequencies. Fire, air, water, and earth are different radio frequencies, or radio stations. If you are a water person, then you are tuned into the water station. You will not pick up love vibes coming from the fire or air station. They may be breaking their head trying to prove love to you, but you will not be receiving it because you are tuned in to the water station.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, water and earth signs are compatible with each other. Air and fire signs are compatible with each other.\\n\\nKnowing a person\\'s love language ahead of time can help one avoid a bad choice of partner, or avoid resentment about the partner\\'s way of relating.\\n\\nLook at the element of your Venus sign. Your Venus element is your love language; read below to see how each element understands “love”.\\n\\n(If you want to be super-specific…Look at the elements of the signs of the following: Moon, Venus, Mars, and Cusps of 5th house, 7th house, & 8th house. These planets and house cusps have to do specifically with how we relate to others. Calculate the strongest element within these planets and house cusps. Give the element of Venus\\'s sign an extra point. If you get a tie between two elements, go with the element of your Venus sign.)\\n\\nWhat\\'s your Love Language?\\n\\nLook at your Venus Element\\n\\nWater signs bring the most emotional energy (read: intimate, soul-level bonding) to partnerships. Water needs an emotional, soul-merging to feel love. Water Venus loves deeply and shows it by caring about your well-being and your feelings. Touching and talking alone will not satisfy this Venus; they need to \"feel\" love from you in order to be satisfied in love.\\n\\nFire signs bring the most physical energy (read: sexual energy). Fire Venus needs to be active together to feel love; fun outings, adventurous vacations, etc. And tons of sex. Fire Venus people can seem self-centered because when in love, they feel it coming from inside them, rather than being based on the other person. The other person may be in front of them saying, \"hello, look at me,\" but Fire Venus ignores because they are too busy being consumed with love. They love passionately.\\n\\nEarth signs bring stability and durability (read: a keeper) to partnerships, but have a more limited emotional range. Earthy Venus people need your physical presence near them, but don\\'t get mushy because they won\\'t have it. Emotional expressions should be limited to what you want for dinner, or which movie you want to see. They handle physical and material needs, not emotional ones. Earthy Venus is faithful. In bed, you will appreciate their mastery of the physical. They are sensual.\\n\\nAir signs bring great companionability and intellectual stimulus to partnership but perhaps the least of all emotional energy and physical responsiveness (read: excellent communication, interesting conversations, but of a detached acquaintance-type). Air Venus needs companionship, someone to talk to, someone to hang out with, someone to watch movies with. (But most of all, someone to talk to.) These are friendly people, and even in love, the relationship may seem more like a friendship. This may sound nice, but if you need deep emotional bonding, you will not find it here. If you need a lot of physical presence (as in Earth Venus) forget about Air Venus. Like the wind, they come and go as they please.\\n\\nCompare the 4 love languages more by reading these articles:\\n\\nFire Sign Love Language\\n\\nWater Sign Love Language\\n\\nAir Sign Love Language\\n\\nEarth Sign Love Language\\n\\nWhere are the individuals in their great life cycles and how well do their life agendas fit together? What is the current focus of life? Trying to settle down with a partner who does not have a relationship on their agenda at the time ends up in the notorious situation of a lingering love affair that never progresses to the next step.\\n\\nSaturn is the \"time-clock\" or \"taskmaster\" of our lives. We tend to reassess, rewrite, and focus on the portion of our lives indicated by the house that Saturn is transiting at any given time. Knowing this ahead of time helps to distinguish between genuine and durable compatibility and just a temporary coincidence of meshing desires. A person is highly unlikely to begin or endure in a real relationship if Saturn is not transiting through a \"relationship house.\" (Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto transits can direct our focus, as well, but Saturn is more solidly felt).\\n\\nLook to the house that Saturn, the great time-clock of our lives, is transiting. We are most open to partnerships when Saturn (or Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto) transits through the following Houses:\\n\\nIs it Your Time for a Relationship?\\n\\nOnly if Saturn is Transiting 1 of the following houses in your birthchart\\n\\n4th: Home & Family\\n\\n5th: Pleasure, Romance, Children\\n\\n7th: Marriage\\n\\n8th: Partner\\'s Finances, Psychological issues, Sex\\n\\n10th: Partnering for the purpose of establishing identity or public recognition\\n\\nIn Summary\\n\\nThe 4 questions above describe the broad boundaries of each individual\\'s capacity to relate. These boundaries create the stage on which any relationship must take place, and limits which cannot be crossed. Then, the smaller frame of personal compatibility must be determined only as it fits within these broad boundaries since these ultimately define the outer ranges of any relationship. Compatibility is discussed on the next page.\\n\\nRelated\\n\\nSynastry Interpretations\\n\\nLove & Relationship Articles\\n\\nCite This Page\\n\\nMLA style\\n\\nCorinne Lane. \"Before Determining Compatibility – Individual Capacity to Relate\" Astrolibrary.

If you prefer, see Synastry Interpretations instead.)\\n\\nFire and air are compatible with each other, and they are the yang elements. Earth and water are compatible with each other, and they are the yin elements.\\n\\nIn general, we can see eye to eye with people of our compatible elements. It’s best to start with compatible Sun-sign elements (both yin or both yang). This is really the ideal. Some astrologers say there are so-called compensations for incompatible Sun elements that can make for a bearable relationship. But we tend to disagree. Yang (fire & air) and Yin (earth & water) just don’t see eye to eye. This isn’t necessarily bad, but you will spend a great deal of time explaining yourself to each other. If you are dominant yang energy, you will notice that you need to put in extra effort to understand a yin person, and vice versa. Communication will not be smooth in such a relationship.\\n\\nBeing in a long-term relationship with the wrong energy can actually be detrimental to your health. It’s doable, but not always healthy.\\n\\nThe ideal is compatible Sun elements. If the Suns are compatible, everything else can be worked on. And this is not a asking too much — about half of the population is compatible with your Sun element.

This is not to say that the planets (or the signs) cause anything to happen. What we observe is synchrony – that things are taking place in sync. One movement is flowing throughout our space, heavens, and Earth. Instead of causing, the planets indicate things, describing what is already taking place. But for the sake of convenience, astrologers use phrases like, “your Venus makes you like this,” or “his Mars made him act like that.” Please note that this is only for convenience in communicating. Astrologers know that the planets don’t force us to do anything, any more than your 5:00pm clock forces you to stop working. But you do stop working when the clock strikes 5:00pm, don’t you? And so you pay careful attention to that clock, because that clock will show you when it’s time to go home from work. But the clock never forced you to leave work, neither did it ever seal your fate. In the end, you decide when to leave work. That is the beauty of synchronicity.\\n\\nAs has been mentioned, the Sun and the Moon are included when we say “the planets.” Astrologers do this for convenience. The ten planets of astrology are: Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto[1]. (From our geocentric position, Earth is not included in the list; however Earth\\'s interplay in the scheme of things is denoted by the Ascendant.) However, before the 18th century only the first seven planets were recognized (they were perceivable to the naked eye): Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Since over 2,000 years ago, the seven classical planets were observed to keep time, orbiting steadily on their paths. Perhaps that is why the number seven was symbolic of deity in ancient cultures. The seven were named after Greek gods because their influence was considered to be as such. Seven was the number of days chosen for a week, with each day borrowing its name from one of the classical planets. (The days making up our calendar month were determined based on one complete cycle through the 12 zodiac signs by the moon, from which the word \"month\" comes from.)\\n\\nThe discoveries of Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto corresponded to revolutionary changes in our world, from the Industrial Revolution and discovery of electricity (Uranus), to the financial collapse and interest in world domination of the 1930’s (Pluto). Pluto’s demotion of status to a “dwarf planet” does not change the fact that it is a celestial body participating in the continuous flow of energy in our world. Thus, Pluto is included here as a planet. (Astrology also observes several other asteroids/planetoids, regardless of planetary status. The body is there, thus, it counts.)\\n\\nEach planet symbolizes a different component of life, a different type of energy. In psychological terms, we can call them “needs” or “drives.” Click on the astrology planets above to learn what each one brings to astrology.\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n1.

The Sun represents your will, and its sign determines the dynamic expression of the will, which is carried out through the activity of the other planets in the horoscope. Remember, the sun sign is just the start of your portrait. Think of your horoscope as a painting of you. The characteristics of your Sun sign are the first broad strokes that the artist first lays down on the canvas. The artist outlines your general shape, the planes and angles of your face, the way in which you hold your body. In the same way, your sun sign delineates your fundamental character, your core. Are you introspective? Do you make friends easily? Are you pompous or plain, generous or greedy? How do you cope with responsibility? Are you high-strung or easygoing? The answers may be found in a study of your Sun\\'s position by sign and house, and any aspects from it.\\n\\nInterpretations for the Sun in each zodiac sign are available here: Sun in the Signs\\n\\nInterpretations for the Sun in each House of the birth chart: Sun in Houses\\n\\nReturn to Top Return to Leo\\n\\nfull moon planet\\n\\nThe Moon\\n\\n“I feel”\\n\\nBest quality: Adaptability Worst quality: Inconstancy\\n\\nThe Moon is as important as the Sun in your natal chart. The Sun sign is a part of you that is apparent to others; it is what others see. The Moon sign is the part of you that you see. The Moon represents your emotional nature and instinctive reactions – emotional responses based on past experiences and unconscious habit patterns that you have developed. It comprises all the little surface peculiarities, moods, and changes that have to do with physical life which are disturbing, fleeting, and changing. It describes the way you behave in instances in which you haven’t had time to think things through, your immediate emotional responses. Have you ever done something that you immediately regretted and thought, “that’s not like me.” It may have been your Moon sign qualities at work. The sign that the Moon is in shows what makes you feel emotionally nurtured, secure, and satisfied. Because emotions run so deep, the Moon sign represents your greatest need. It also shows how you nurture others. Most of the time, your Moon sign will only be apparent to those who live with you, or people that are very close to you. In many ways, your Moon personality is the one you keep hidden. It is your inner core, which feels hate, jealousy, fear, and has fantasies that you often deny even to yourself. On the other hand, it is your Moon personality that spontaneously feels and expresses joy and pleasure. It is the part of you that enjoys the little sensualities of life. The Moon in your horoscope modifies your Sun sign; it brings new forces, different motivations, and spiritual elements to the character of your Sun sign. For example, a Gemini-Sun person with Moon in Taurus will be more dependable than a Gemini-Sun with Moon in Aquarius. Here is another reason why we cannot define a person simply by their Sun sign.\\n\\nThe Moon is also a symbol of fertility and femininity; its sign colors one\\'s relationship with the mother, and with women in general. In a male\\'s chart, it indicates the type of woman he feels most comfortable with. Although the Venus sign indicates a male\\'s romantic/erotic preference in partners, the Moon sign indicates the type of woman he would choose as a lifelong mate (because the Moon \"needs\" are stronger than the Venus \"wants\").\\n\\nThe Moon is constantly waxing and waning, from new Moon to full Moon and back. The house position of the Moon in your natal chart shows the area of life where you tend to be the most emotional, and where you often experience changing conditions. The house of the Moon also gives clues to the type of activity that occurs on the domestic scene.\\n\\nInterpretations for the Moon in each zodiac sign are available here: Moon in the Signs\\n\\nInterpretations for the Moon in each House of the birth chart: Moon in Houses\\n\\nReturn to Top Return to Cancer\\n\\nmercury planet astrology\\n\\nMercury\\n\\n“I think”\\n\\nBest quality: Expression Worst quality: Restlessness\\n\\nMercury is the planet of intelligence and communication. It governs our rational and intellectual faculties, perception and reason, memory, speaking, and writing. Mercury reflects your capacity to collect, sort, and communicate the knowledge you gain through your experiences and your senses. It reflects the way you see, hear, understand, and assimilate information. Mercury is symbolic of that child-like curiosity that drives your urge to know, and the ability to analyze and reason. Mercury also has to do with transportation and short trips, and the nervous system. The positive manifestations of Mercury include clever speech, eloquence, persuasiveness, success with public speaking and a sharp, quick mind. The more negative manifestations include restlessness, a tendency to be critical, sarcastic, argumentative and sly. The quick wit of Mercury can quickly turn into trickery. Lies, deceit, fraud, swindling, and forgery are examples of Mercury’s negative power. The sign of Mercury in your natal chart shows your style and preferences of communicating and learning. A strong Mercury in one\\'s chart, free of any negative aspects, indicates a brilliant mind.\\n\\nInterpretations for Mercury in each zodiac sign are available here: Mercury in the Signs\\n\\nInterpretations for Mercury in each House of the birth chart: Mercury in Houses\\n\\nReturn to Top Return to Gemini Return to Virgo\\n\\nvenus astrology planet real image\\n\\nVenus\\n\\n“I love”\\n\\nBest quality: Affection Worst quality: Pliancy (bending too easily, taking the easy way out)\\n\\nVenus is the planet of love, pleasure, and beauty. It represents your capacity to express affection and to enjoy beauty. This includes your capacity to attract and appreciate the things of the world, whether they are emotional, physical/material, mental, or spiritual things. It defines the type of people you draw to yourself, based on your social values. Things ruled by Venus include: what kind of sex appeal you posses, love affairs, the arts, beauty and beautiful things, adornment, affection, the social graces, harmony, and friendship. Being the planet of pleasure, it points to the kinds of amusements you are drawn to and in what ways you spend your money. The position of Venus in your natal chart can answer such questions as: What kind of lovers do you attract? Are you flirtatious? Do you find happiness in your love affairs, or are you often disappointed? Where do your creative talents lie? The sign of Venus gives important information about how you expresses yourself in personal relationships, especially in love and marriage. It also indicates your attitude toward money, personal possessions, creature comforts, and social and aesthetic values. Your Venus sign also reveals your idea of the \"perfect woman.\" In a male\\'s chart, the Venus sign indicates the type of woman that attracts him. In a woman\\'s chart, the Venus sign indicates the qualities that she uses to attract lovers. The house position of Venus indicates the type of people with whom you establish relationships, both friendships and romances, and where you are most likely to find an artistic outlet.\\n\\nVenus never travels far from the Sun. In your horoscope, it is always either in your Sun sign or in one of the two signs immediately preceding or following your Sun sign. A well-aspected Venus bestows charm, diplomacy, and tact. Some negative manifestations of Venus are self-indulgence, jealousy, envy, lust, and of course, unfaithfulness.\\n\\nInterpretations for Venus in each zodiac sign are available here: Venus in the Signs\\n\\nInterpretations for Venus in each House of the birth chart: Venus in Houses\\n\\nReturn to Top Return to Taurus Return to Libra\\n\\nastrology planet mars real image\\n\\nMars\\n\\n“I act”\\n\\nBest quality: Initiative Worst quality: Harshness\\n\\nMars is the exact opposite of Venus. Whereas Venus represents the female, Mars is all male. Whereas Venus is about harmony, Mars is conflict, aggression, and outright war. Mars is the planet of physical energy. It governs your sex drive, your forcefulness and your aggression. It is associated with your desires and aspirations for emotional, physical, mental and spiritual things that stimulate activity. You have to want something before you reach out and take it; Mars is the heated passion behind action. Mars shows your ability to turn ideas into action. The sign of Mars in your natal chart indicates your vitality, energy level, and style of action. In a female\\'s chart, the Mars sign is one factor suggesting the type of man she attracts. In its highest form, Mars represent your unleashed energy and your human will – initiative. A controlled Mars can give a healthy dose of assertiveness and ambition. At its worst, Mars energy makes one prone to anger, harshness and destructive violence, impulsive behavior, danger, combativeness and every kind of cruelty. It’s up to you to use this force constructively.\\n\\nInterpretations for Mars in each zodiac sign are available here: Mars in the Signs.\\n\\nInterpretations for Mars in each House of the birth chart: Mars in Houses\\n\\nReturn to Top Return to Aries\\n\\njupiter astrology planet\\n\\nJupiter\\n\\n“I grow”\\n\\nBest quality: Benevolence (kindness) Worst quality: Conceit\\n\\nJupiter is the planet of good luck, optimism, success and generosity. Jupiter brings joy to life. Think expansiveness and abundance, as Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system. Jupiter signifies knowledge, higher leaning, breadth of vision, confidence, charity and good-will, frankness and honesty. Jupiter’s knowledge is on a philosophical level (as opposed to Mercury’s day-to-day cleverness). It is the broad view of the higher mind. Psychologically, Jupiter is the search for meaning or truth. As such, it represents law and justice, philosophy, religion, metaphysics, and education. Jupiter encompasses the urge for self-improvement through participation in the larger whole. It urges you to go forth exploring life. Jupiter\\'s sign indicates what you idealize, what your ethical, religious, and philosophical standards are. The sign also indicates where you express expansiveness, where you do things on a large scale. Jupiter in your chart shows where you are likely to receive financial and material benefits, and in turn, where you express generosity to others. The House of Jupiter is where we tend to be optimistic, and the affairs of that House usually flow easily. Jupiter’s qualities include benevolence (kindness), wisdom, morality, and spirituality. If negatively placed in the chart, Jupiter’s energy can be manifested as self-righteousness, excessiveness, squandering, exaggeration, over-indulgence, superficiality, and bigotry. However, even when negatively positioned, Jupiter is protective and beneficial. Over-indulgence and excess often lead to learning the lesson of restraint. Even with a negatively-aspected Jupiter, a person will tend to \"land on their feet\" when problems arise in the areas signified by Jupiter\\'s House.\\n\\nInterpretations for Jupiter in each zodiac sign are available here: Jupiter in the Signs\\n\\nInterpretations for Jupiter in each House of the birth chart: Jupiter in Houses\\n\\nReturn to Top Return to Sagittarius\\n\\nastrology planet saturn with ring\\n\\nSaturn\\n\\n“I achieve”\\n\\nBest quality: System and Organization Worst quality: Selfishness\\n\\nAstrologers of the past regarded Saturn as \"evil\" and malignant, indicating dire misfortune and misery wherever it was found in a chart. When Venus wishes for love, Saturn denies her. When Jupiter promises good fortune, Saturn delays it. When Mercury brings news, Saturn degrades it, and when Mars goes too hard or too fast, Saturn will crash him. But this is not necessarily bad. Saturn is associated with the principles of limitation, restrictions, boundaries, safety, practicality, reality, seriousness, and structures. Saturn is the laws, boundaries and limits set by society or karma. Modern astrologers acknowledge that the hardships brought on by Saturn\\'s limitations, compel one to continue striving for a final product, that although delayed, will be solid and of real worth.\\n\\nSaturn governs ambition, career, authority, hierarchy, and conforming social structures. It concerns a person\\'s sense of duty, discipline and responsibility, and their physical and emotional endurance during hardships. Saturn is morose and cold, melancholic, and serious. By placement in your chart, it indicates the area of life in which you may feel shame, for a time. This is the area where you have lessons to learn. But this is where your disciplined hard work will lead to genuinely earned, long-lasting success. At its best, Saturn endows organization and order. At its worst, Saturn’s energy is manifested as selfishness. The sign of Saturn also gives clues to the kind of work for which a person is suited and the kind of career he is likely to pursue.\\n\\nInterpretations for Saturn in each zodiac sign are available here: Saturn in the Signs\\n\\nInterpretations for Saturn in each House of the birth chart: Saturn in Houses\\n\\nReturn to Top Return to Capricorn\\n\\nastrology planet uranus on its side with ring\\n\\nUranus\\n\\n“I evolve”\\n\\nBest quality: Originality Worst quality: Rebellion\\n\\nUranus represents the unconscious urge to become aware of your true inner individuality (the Sun). Like a lightning bolt, Uranus symbolizes sudden flashes of insight, moments of revelation, and spurts of creativity. Uranus’s energy is usually described as suddenness, revolution, change, shock, and disruption. Like lightning, Uranus breaks into time and fractures our patterns. New ideas break into ordinary streams of thought, bringing innovative solutions to stubborn problems. It is your intuition awakening you to a world beyond our social structure. Uranus forces sudden changes when the usefulness of the old is gone and something newer, something higher and better is ready to take its place. Uranus encompasses technology and all types of electronic devices. Uranus speeds up the mind, making it to bypass logic and arrive at conclusions by leaping from A to Z, shocking people. Uranus seeks alternatives to the common and accepted forms. True to itself, the planet Uranus stands out from the rest of the planets by orbiting around on its \"side.\" The rest of the planets orbit like a \"spinning top,\" but Uranus insists on rolling on its side like a ball. At best, Uranus encourages originality, versatility and independence. At worst, it encourages eccentricity, perversion and rebellion. Uranus demands freedom.\\n\\nInterpretations for Uranus in each zodiac sign are available here: Uranus in the Signs\\n\\nInterpretations for Uranus in each House of the birth chart: Uranus in Houses\\n\\nReturn to Top Return to Aquarius\\n\\nneptune astrology planet\\n\\nNeptune\\n\\n“I dream”\\n\\nBest quality: Idealism Worst quality: Vagueness\\n\\nNeptune represents the unconscious urge to dissolve the boundaries of your ego-centeredness in order to ‘lose yourself’ in other realms of being. While Uranus breaks into our dimension to allow momentary flashes of insight into other realms of existence, Neptune is those other realms. Neptune dissolves life’s patterns in order to teach new meanings in the quest for universal wisdom. Neptune represents things that aren’t quite as they appear, the illusive, and the unreal. It is the planet of receptivity, imagination, cloudiness, confusion, delusion, illusion, and unreality. Neptune is also associated with movies, acting, and compassion. Neptune can indicate mystical visions of a divine creator, or an experience of the primordial chaos before creation (dangerously, the latter can drive one to madness). Neptune can indicate spiritual healing and service to others, or becoming lost in a foggy world of fantasy and dreams. More often than not, Neptune indicates confusion in the House where it resides in your birth chart. A negatively positioned Neptune in the natal chart can indicate a tendency to escape reality. The house and sign will indicate whether it be through mind-altering drugs and alcohol, day-dreaming, sexual addiction, cult worship, psychosis, potential suicide, or others. At its best, Neptune\\'s energy inspires marvelous art, music, theatre, dance, poetry, and film. Above all, Neptune represents the intangible, and makes it very real.\\n\\nInterpretations for Neptune in each zodiac sign are available here: Neptune in the Signs\\n\\nInterpretations for Neptune in each House of the birth chart: Neptune in Houses\\n\\nReturn to Top Return to Pisces\\n\\nastrology planet pluto\\n\\nPluto\\n\\n“I empower”\\n\\nBest quality: Transformation Worst quality: Inversion (turning things upside down)\\n\\n(See Why Pluto is still valid even though it’s not a planet anymore)\\n\\nPluto represents the unconscious urge to transform repressed ego-desire energies into group-desire energies in order to live out your role in society’s evolution. Pluto represents sexuality (the act itself, as opposed to the energetic desire which is associated with Mars), obsessive desires, transformation, power, and the ingredients of great wealth (investments, banking, loans, debt, mortgages). Pluto has dominion over drastic changes that bring true upheavals. Since Pluto is the slowest-moving planet, an entire generation will share the same Pluto sign, giving it historical importance. Drastic and permanent changes in civilization as a whole can be linked to Pluto\\'s movement through the signs. On a personal level, the House that Pluto occupies in your chart will show how Plutonian energy is manifested in your life. Pluto will transform those things in your life that require regeneration, whether you desire it or not. You may experience dramatic crises or have to endure terrible suffering where Pluto is involved in your chart, but for the purpose of healing. Pluto tears down only to transform and regenerate what has been destroyed. Pluto is associated with recklessness, mental obsession and compulsion, emotional resistance, and overall transcendence. It is also associated with unsolved mysteries, secrets, and taboos.\\n\\nInterpretations for Pluto in each zodiac sign are available here: Pluto in the Signs\\n\\nInterpretations for Pluto in each House of the birth chart: Pluto in Houses\\n\\nReturn to Top Return to Scorpio\\n\\nCite This Page\\n\\nMLA style\\n\\nCorinne Lane. \"Planets in Astrology – Lesson 5\" Astrolibrary.

These three classifications essentially define the zodiac signs. Just by knowing the element, quality, and polarity, you would be able to describe the fundamental traits of each zodiac sign without actually learning the sign. This is a very important lesson, indeed.\\n\\nThe author considers this the single most important lesson of the zodiac. The elements, qualities, and polarities are the fundamental, underlying nature of each zodiac sign. Learn these!\\n\\nElements | Qualities | Polarities\\n\\nZodiac Elements\\n\\nThe element of a zodiac sign reveals the basic temperament of the sign. The element of your Sun, Moon, or Rising sign are of significant importance, but the overall distribution of elements in your chart is what counts the most. Having more than 4 planets in an element will have an impact on your behavior, even if that element does not correspond to your Sun sign. An abundance (5 or more), or a lack (0-2), of an element has much impact on your temperament. See Balance of Elements.\\n\\nThere are four zodiac elements, with three zodiac signs belonging to each element group. The elements are interchangeably called \"triplicities;\" this is because there are three (triple) signs per element. The four elements are Fire, Earth, Air, and Water.\\n\\nFire Zodiac Element\\n\\nThe fire signs are Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius. Fire signs respond to energy very quickly. They favor action. They\\'re ready to go, take a risk, start a business, go on a trip, etc. They are confident, idealistic, intense, and approach life with zest and enthusiasm. Here is energy to conquer, lead, and travel physically and mentally. Aries must act, Leo must lead grandly, and Sagittarius explores unknown places and ideas.\\n\\nPositive keywords: extroverted, energetic, enthusiastic, inspirational, visionary, high-spirited, simple and direct, physically active, dramatic, courageous, warm.\\n\\nNegative keywords: overly active to the point of burnout, restless, impatient, selfish, insensitive, willful, hasty, lacking in perspective, thoughtless, impulsive, reckless, extravagant, wild.\\n\\nSee the love style of the fire signs.\\n\\nEarth Zodiac Element\\n\\nThe Earth signs are Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn. Earth signs are more cautious in their approach. They are more practical, realistic, and they need solid footing before going forward. Taurus will dig the heels in and really ponder things. Virgo will analyze. Capricorn will climb, but will do it with care, first needing a vision, a plan, an organized structure before starting the ascent. Earth signs are dependable, thorough and solid.\\n\\nEarth signs seek to engage the physical world and master it through efficient organization. Earth signs seek economic security, respect, and prestige, and they work hard for it.\\n\\nPositive keywords: practical, efficient, organized, realistic, patient, self-disciplined, hard-working, productive, enduring, persistent, dependable, stable, good common sense.\\n\\nNegative keywords: slow, stodgy, lacking in vision, unimaginative, petty, excessively conventional, narrow-minded, stubborn, resistant to change, hoarding, ultra conservative.\\n\\nSee the love style of the earth signs.\\n\\nAir Zodiac Element\\n\\nThe Air signs are Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius. Air signs approach energy mentally; they are thinkers. They are social, always ready for a new relationship or friendship. They love learning, but bore easily. Gemini has great intellectual curiosity, but too many personalities. Libra is partnership driven, but not in an emotional way. Aquarius is popular with friends and is unstoppable when it has a cause to champion. Air signs are into ideas and people. They are communicative; they must share information, interact with others, and influence society.\\n\\nPositive keywords: articulate, objective, mentally clear, detached, capable of forethought, understanding, socially adept and adaptable, cooperative, relational.\\n\\nNegative keywords: unemotional, lacking in sympathy, impractical, disassociated from the body and the physical world, over-adaptive, abstracted, glib and facile, hyperactive.\\n\\nSee the love style of the air signs.\\n\\nWater Zodiac Element\\n\\nWater signs respond to energy almost unconsciously. They are deeply emotional. Cancer is motivated to nurture and be nurtured. Scorpio has intense vision, never swaying, looking straight ahead with laser-like focus. Pisces is the trickiest to describe. Pisces energy is chameleon-like, absorbing its surroundings.\\n\\nPositive keywords: deeply emotional, sympathetic, empathetic, nurturing, calm and peaceful, sensitive, compassionate, imaginative, intuitive, psychically aware.\\n\\nNegative keywords: emotionally insecure and unstable, shy, timid, lacking in confidence, oversensitive, easily influenced and manipulated, withdrawn, uncommunicative, vindictive and vengeful, takes everything personally, moody and depressed.\\n\\nSee the love style of the water signs.\\n\\nZodiac Qualities\\n\\nThe qualities, also called \"modes,\" or “modalities,” indicate how people respond to stimuli, and especially how they act under tension. They indicate how the signs express their element, meaning the mode of behavior they use to express the element needs. There are three qualities: Cardinal, Fixed, and Mutable. They are also called \"quadruplicities\" because there are 4 signs per group. To learn how to calculate the balance of qualities in a birth chart, see Balance of Qualities.\\n\\nInterestingly, there’s one sign from each element in each group of qualities. So, in the Cardinal Signs group, there’s one fire sign, one earth sign, one air sign, and one water sign.\\n\\nCardinal Signs\\n\\nAries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn\\n\\nCardinal Signs are the most assertive, the most interested in initiating change. Their mode of activity is to start new things. They easily begin things and respond well to new ideas. They are self-starters. Crisis motivates them. They achieve control by remaining one step ahead of everyone else. Aries seeks leadership and control in general, Cancer controls emotions, home, and family; Libra tries to control partnerships; Capricorn controls, uses, and exploits the material environment. For Cardinal signs, things are always happening. This is usually because they are doing the starting. The four Cardinal signs are at the first month of each season.\\n\\nFixed Signs\\n\\nTaurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius\\n\\nFixed Signs are the most stable and self-contained. Their mode of activity is sort of passive, yet determined, unwavering, and even stubborn. Their strength is their consistency and loyalty. They follow things through to the end, managing and sustaining what has been started by the Cardinal signs. They may go to denial in times of change. They are very resistant to change, needing to take time to prep themselves. They tend to be late: Taurus is just slow; Scorpio uses tardiness as a subtle power struggle; Leo enjoys making an entrance; Aquarius wants things on their own terms. Late, but once there, they stay forever. The four Fixed signs are at the middle month of each season.\\n\\nMutable Signs\\n\\nGemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces\\n\\nMutable Signs are the most unstable and most open to influence by the environment. Their mode of activity is to make the transition from the old to the new, opening the way for the Cardinal Signs to begin a new cycle. They are infinitely flexible and tolerant. They find it naturally easy to let go. Whereas Cardinal signs begin new things, and Fixed signs sustain things, Mutable energy loosens structures and adapts it to new and changing conditions. With this territory comes mental worry. Mutable signs have many things going on in their heads rather than in tangible form. Many react by making lists. Some suffer from negative mental tension, involving fear, paranoia, and panic attacks. In anticipating negative outcomes, they really suffer during the worry process. But their high adaptability always sees them through. Gemini is changeable in its ideas; Virgo is dominated by its environment; Sagittarius has a continually changing view of life\\'s possibilities; Pisces adapts itself superficially to its environment (like a chameleon) and reflects it like a mirror. Sometimes they compromise so much that they sacrifice their own interests. The four Mutable signs are at the final month of each season.\\n\\nBetween elements, qualities, and signs, there is only one combination of each, making each zodiac sign unique. For example, there is only 1 cardinal fire sign, only 1 cardinal earth sign, only 1 cardinal air sign, etc. You can understand the nature of each sign by examining these energetic combinations. See the table below (or open in Print/Download View).\\n\\nFire Earth Air Water Cardinal Aries Capricorn Libra Cancer Fixed Leo Taurus Aquarius Scorpio Mutable Sagittarius Virgo Gemini Pisces\\n\\nZodiac Polarities\\n\\nThe two polarities are sometimes referred to as male/female, positive/negative, or yang/yin. Modern astrologers prefer to call the polarities active/receptive. This type of duality is the earliest form of classification. Six of the zodiac signs are yang energy, which is also known as “masculine” energy. The six yang signs are Aries, Leo, Sagittarius, Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius. These are the Fire and Air signs. These signs are more active and assertive rather than receptive.\\n\\nThe other six signs are yin energy, which is also known as “feminine” energy. The six yin signs are Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn, Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces. These are the Earth and Water signs.

If you prefer, see Zodiac Compatibility instead.)\\n\\nIn discussing compatibility, we will overlook “initial attraction” (for now). The difference between “initial attraction” and “compatibility” is great, for the first never ensures the second, and the second can manifest without the first, as many of us are forced to find out in the course of our lives. Here we focus on compatibility, and whether it exists between two people who are already past the “initial attraction” stage of a relationship.\\n\\nCompatibility between two people is not so much a thing, as it is the absence of a thing – absence of friction. Now, compatibility is not simply the sort of harmony that takes place when we are on a romantic date. Men and women tend to be on their best behavior on a date, putting their best foot forward and performing all the charming niceties that are expected from a romantic encounter. In a way, it can be said that people on dates are performing an act. There will be an illusion of compatibility on any romantic date, even between incompatible lovers. This is not a true measure of compatibility because the people in those cases are acting a part.\\n\\nCompatibility Relationship, Compatible couple, man and woman in movie theater\\n\\nTrue compatibility can only be determined based on our natural dispositions, our real personalities, our deep-seated mannerisms and habits. It can only be determined on “the morning after,” when the charming date from the night before reveals his/her ordinary habits, peculiar quirks, eccentricities and other daily behaviors. Often, these daily idiosyncrasies are what drives couples apart or attracts genuine admiration.\\n\\nSo, compatibility is the lucky situation in which both partners can be themselves without irritating each other. If you have to alter your behavior or style so as not to annoy your partner, then compatibility is lacking. Also, if you have to grit your teeth to acquiesce to your partner’s expression of his/herself, compatibility is lacking. If simply being yourselves causes friction with each other, compatibility is lacking.\\n\\nThis is really a matter of energy flow. For example, try joining the positive ends of two magnets. They will not stick together regardless of how “attractive” or “charming” they are. Their energies repel each other. Humans are similar to magnets because we are part of a universal field consisting of an ebb and flow of energy. But unlike magnets, we humans are very complex, and we have many more points to consider than just “positive” and “negative.” Everyone has some great qualities, but not everyone is compatible with you.\\n\\nSince compatibility is really a matter of smooth energy flow between two people, not much can be done to “fix” an incompatible union. An incompatible couple is one in which the natural energy of one partner clashes with the natural energy of the other. It is unfair and sad that many divorcing and separating couples hurt each other in great proportions by bashing each other’s personalities, when the real problem may be a simple mismatch of energies (like repelling magnets).\\n\\nIncompatible couples can possibly succeed in a relationship, but it will require a lot of work and planned romantic dates. You may get along during the artificial scenarios (dates), but the incompatible partner will always rub you the wrong way just by being him/herself when you are not on a date. Their natural manner of being will irritate you. This is because your energies don’t blend well. As a result, the union creates tension, stress, and unhappiness.\\n\\nCompatible couples do not need many extras; they can simply enjoy being in each other’s presence. They can be themselves without causing friction in the relationship. This is because their energies flow together nicely. As a result, such a union creates happiness.\\n\\nOf course, no two people are perfectly compatible in every way (not that we are aware of). Compatibility, as we know it, exists in levels. Higher levels of compatibility result in happier relationships.\\n\\nAstrology, as the unique language of energy, is the most powerful tool available for determining compatibility, before risking years in a relationship. But even if you’ve been married for years, astrology can actually pinpoint the deep root of problem areas in your relationship. Astrology helps people learn how to deal with each other because it reveals the inner workings of their psyches. Even if you are stuck with an incompatible partner, astrology will get you to say, “Now I know why he/she is like that.”\\n\\nNumerous astrological techniques can (and should) be used to determine compatibility levels between two lovers. Some of these astrological techniques are simple and fun, such as comparing Venus, Mars, and Moon signs. Other techniques are far more complicated. All methods of determining compatibility fall under the magnificent and special branch of astrology: synastry.\\n\\nThe comparison of two birth charts in astrology is called synastry. The art of synastry is perhaps the most beloved branch of astrology. Synastry is discussed on the following page.\\n\\nRelated\\n\\nSynastry Interpretations\\n\\nLove & Relationship Articles\\n\\nCite This Page\\n\\nMLA style\\n\\nCorinne Lane. \"Compatibility in Love Relationships\" Astrolibrary.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/12 Astrological Houses – Astrology Lesson 4.html'}, page_content='Astrolibrary logo\\n\\nAstroLibrary 🔎\\n\\nDaily Personalized Horoscope ↗\\n\\n12 Astrological Houses – Astrology Lesson 4\\n\\n1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | 6th | 7th | 8th | 9th | 10th | 11th | 12th\\n\\nThe 12 Houses of astrology are arranged on a circle-shaped chart, or wheel.\\n\\nDo not confuse the wheel of Houses with the zodiac wheel. They are 2 different wheels.\\n\\nThe zodiac wheel is based on the sun’s apparent yearly rotation about our Earth, along the ecliptic.\\n\\nThe wheel of Houses is based on our Earth’s 24-hour rotation about its own axis.\\n\\nThe 2 wheels join together at points derived by calculations involving your exact birth time and astronomical birth coordinates.\\n\\nThen, the planets are described in 2 ways: as being in a zodiac sign, and also as being in a House.\\n\\nFor example, two people may both have a Libra Sun sign, but one may have the Libra Sun in his 12th House, while the other may have his Libra Sun in his 1st house. This could make for two very different types of people.\\n\\n(Another reason why the popular daily Sun Sign Horoscopes are a bunch of silliness: they are written assuming everyone has their Sun in the 1st House.)\\n\\nThe 12 Houses of astrology are symbolic of the all the departments that make up human life. The planets and zodiac signs will manifest themselves most strongly in the sphere of life represented by the House in which they fall on your chart (and also in the House which they rule; more on House Rulerships below).\\n\\nRemember, the houses are not “energies” like the elements or planets, nor do they color the expression of energies like the zodiac signs do. The houses are WHERE these energies are most likely to manifest. The houses are the fields of experience, not the experience themselves.\\n\\nNotice how the order of the Houses follows the developmental path of a human’s life, from the original impulse of individual being (1st house), to learning what is “mine” and how to use what one owns (2nd house), to learning how to communicate within the limitations set by our environment (3rd house), etc. The following description of the Houses are short and topical, directed at beginners.\\n\\nThe most important houses are the 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th houses. These are called the \"angular houses\" because their cusps coincide with the 4 special angles: ascendant, I.C., descendant, and M.C.. Planets in the angular houses will influence you the most.\\n\\n1st Astrological House\\n\\nThe first House is the House of self. This includes self-awareness, the physical body, personality, appearance, personal views on life, self-identity, self-image, early environment, and beginnings; how we initiate, how we’re impulsive. Any planets in this house will greatly influence your personality and how others perceive you.\\n\\nTop\\n\\n2nd Astrological House\\n\\nThe second House refers to your own money and possessions, what you value, your hidden talents, sense of self-worth, self-esteem (how you value yourself, instead of describing your personality as in the 1st House). Possessions include anything a person owns (except the house/home which is ruled by the 4th House): cars, furniture, clothing, moveable property, investments and securities, etc. The 2nd house specifies how you gain and spend your own money (as opposed to other\\'s money in the 8th house), your attitude towards wealth and material possessions, and your potential for accumulating it/them.\\n\\nTop\\n\\n3rd Astrological House\\n\\nThe third House is that of communication, which by extension includes one\\'s immediate environment: siblings, neighbors, short journeys, and all forms of transportation. The 3rd house also includes the intellect, the lower mind (details and small bits of information as opposed to the higher mind in 9th house), thinking patterns, and early education (before college). Communication includes messages, deliveries, gossip, phone calls, visits, reading and writing.\\n\\nTop\\n\\n4th Astrological House\\n\\nThe fourth House refers to the home and everything associated with it (both the childhood home & the current home): family, land, personal foundations (inner emotional security), your roots. Astrologers are divided over whether this house is associated with one\\'s mother or father. What is clear is that a person\\'s upbringing is associated with this House.\\n\\nOn a deeper level, the 4th house is the base of consciousness or the center of our concrete existence. See how the cusp of the 4th house is the I.C., the lowest point on the chart, representative of things below the surface of Earth. Due to that, the 4th house was believed to rule the conditions at the end of life, and graves. As the root or base of your real self, the 4th house rules where you go when you \"die\" but also where you came from. For those who believe in reincarnation, the 4th house would give clues to your karmic lesson for this lifetime. It shows what karmic baggage you brought with you into this life. Even if you don\\'t believe in reincarnation, you\\'re likely to be surprised by what you find in your 4th house for it may move your soul.\\n\\nAny planets in the 4th house affect your home life, your emotions, your subconscious, and possibly your relationship with your parents.\\n\\nTop\\n\\n5th Astrological House\\n\\nThe fifth House refers to children, creativity, and the pursuit of pleasure. This includes personal interests, love affairs, sports, hobbies, speculation, risk-taking, teaching, drama, creative self-expression, love given, gambling. The 5th house is all about you being yourself and enjoying it.\\n\\nRomance, dating, love affairs, and sexual relationships are ruled by this 5th house, yet marriage is assigned to the 7th. Why? Because, until very recently, marriage was not entered into for pleasure, for love, nor for personal fulfillment. Marriage was hardly even entered into by choice, but rather for the purpose of raising kids to preserve the values of a particular culture or religion. And these marriages were most often arranged according to class and financial status, a partnership befitting the 7th house.\\n\\nNowadays, it\\'s common to marry for love. To avoid confusion, remember: affairs of the heart are in the 5th house, but cooperative partnerships are in the domain of the 7th house.\\n\\nTop\\n\\n6th Astrological House\\n\\nThe sixth House refers to daily work, service, diet, health and physical sickness, physical ability to work, employees. This includes volunteer labor, civil service work, caretaking, and mundane daily tasks. The 6th house really involves the quality of your work, the quality of the jobs you perform, as opposed to an actual career (career is represented by the 10th house). Daily mundane tasks include personal hygiene and our method of responding to everyday crises.\\n\\nTop\\n\\n7th Astrological House\\n\\nThe seventh House is sometimes referred to as the House of marriage, but it encompasses all one-to-one relationships: marriage, business partnerships, contracts, cooperative relationships, and also divorce, separation, quarrels, open enemies, and law suits.\\n\\nThe difference between the love affairs of the 5th House and love relationships of the 7th is that the 7th House refers to more permanently binding relationships, whereas the 5th House refers to affairs that may be temporary. When the 5th House affair progresses into a serious relationship, we can say that the relationship has \"moved into the 7th House.\"\\n\\n7th house relationships are about cooperation and sharing, and they generally serve some functional purpose in the larger social community (i.e. a marriage). This is different from a 5th house love affair, whose only qualification is \"butterflies in the stomach.\"\\n\\nThe 7th house includes the way you relate to those closest to you. Planets in this house will influence your manner of relating. They also give clues to issues that arise in your relationships.\\n\\nTop\\n\\n8th Astrological House\\n\\nSimply put, the 8th house is the polar opposite of the 2nd house. Whereas the 2nd rules your own individual possessions, the 8th house rules what a relationship owns (joint finances).\\n\\nThe 8th House is one of the most misunderstood Houses. This is probably because the things represented by the 8th House seem to have nothing in common with each other, or they seem to be negative. This House governs death, regeneration, taxes, inheritances, wills & legacies, sex (the actual act of sex), latent occult ability, joint resources, your partner’s money and possessions, spouse\\'s money, bankruptcy, losses, personal sacrifices, alimony, clairvoyance.\\n\\nOn a positive note, this House is about transformation and healing. But transformation and healing require some type of death, loss, or injury first. This House rules those processes and things by which we transform and become more powerful. Yes, this includes the act of sex.\\n\\nTop\\n\\n9th Astrological House\\n\\nThe ninth House refers to philosophy, religion, law, learning, higher education (as opposed to early education by the 3rd House), ethics, morals, long journeys, travel, foreign countries and interests, spiritual urges, dreams, visions, higher mind, ideas, understanding and wisdom, books, publishing, ceremonies, and rituals. This is the House of big thoughts and big ideas.\\n\\n9th house \"understanding\" is more complex than 3rd house \"knowledge\". The act of \"knowing\" belongs to the 3rd house because it implies simply the direct contact of a person with something in his environment. Understanding involves the synthesis of known data.\\n\\nWhile the 3rd house refers to an individual\\'s need to understand his close and personal environment, the 9th house is an area in which one seeks to discover the significance of larger fields of social existence which one may not experience directly but which his mind may explore through the use of analogy, generalization and abstraction. The 3rd and 9th houses symbolize the 2 polarities of the human mind, the concrete and the abstract.\\n\\nIn summary, the 9th house includes experiences that we encounter when we search for the meaning of things. Whatever expands your field of activity or the scope of your mind – long journeys, contact with other cultures, great dreams, and even experiences with fortunetellers.\\n\\nTop\\n\\n10th Astrological House\\n\\nThe tenth House is the House of status, honor, community power, prestige, reputation, and professional career. In our society, this includes financial success, but only as it relates to community power and prestige. It\\'s not about gaining \"material stuff\" as it is in the 2nd house. The 10th house wants success for the sake of honor and social status.\\n\\nThis house includes social foundations (as opposed to personal home foundations in the 4th), recognition, personal achievements, social responsibilities, sense of duty, authority figures, politicians. This House encompasses the most public areas of one\\'s life, and the career that you grow into, as opposed to daily work and odd jobs ruled by the 6th House.\\n\\nAs with the 4th House, astrologers are divided over whether the 10th House rules one\\'s mother or father. Those that say the 4th House rules the mother, say the 10th House rules the father, and vice versa. What is clear is that the 4th House rules the nurturing, home-body parent, while the 10th House rules the public, success-focused parent (the parent who \"wears the pants\").\\n\\nAs with the other angular houses, any planets in this house are very important. Planets in the 10th house, the sign on the cusp of the 10th house, and its ruling planet will greatly influence your career and your general reputation in public.\\n\\nTop\\n\\n11th Astrological House\\n\\nThe eleventh House is the House of community, large groups, and friends. It refers to memberships, hopes, goals, ambitions, wishes, social groups, associations, humanitarian interests. It also refers to self-realization, liberty, legislation and regulation.\\n\\nTop\\n\\n12th Astrological House\\n\\nThis is probably the most misunderstood house of all. The twelfth House refers to the subconscious, the hidden self that exists apart from our physical everyday reality. This includes the unconscious mind, subconscious memory, subconscious habit patterns from the past, mental illness, karmic debts, self-deception, escapism, spiritual realization, limitations, frustration, and ultimately our self-undoing.\\n\\nOn a physical, material level, the 12th house includes things that take us away from everyday life: institutions (such as hospitals, prisons, government offices), places of confinement, secrets, secret relationships, hidden enemies, and self-sacrifice for others. It also refers to sorrow, tribulations, widowhood, grief, funerals, exile, seclusion, bribery, subversion, murder, suicide, kidnapping, and endings.\\n\\nFor those who believe, the 12th house is also considered to refer to the collective unconscious of all humanity.\\n\\nTop\\n\\nastrology houses labeled chart\\n\\nastrology houses labeled chart in color\\n\\n“Natural” Houses of the Planets & Signs\\n\\nEach planet and zodiac sign is naturally associated with a House, the House that most corresponds to its archetype. The planet, then, is said to be the “Natural Ruler” of that House, or more often, it’s said to be “at home” in that House.\\n\\nThe House/planet associations were adjusted with the discoveries of Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. The following table lists the current House rulers, along with the traditional rulers. The traditional rulers are still considered to be co-rulers of that House (along with the new planet that rules the House).\\n\\nNote: in your own birth chart, the rulers of your houses are determined by the signs that fall on the cusps of your houses. However, the natural rulers, listed here, give a subtle influence.\\n\\nTable of Natural Ruling Planets of Each House\\n\\nHouse Keywords Zodiac Sign Natural Ruler Traditional Ruler 1st self, life, body Aries Mars 2nd possessions, money, material circumstances, livelihood Taurus Venus 3rd local movement, short journeys, communication, school, siblings Gemini Mercury 4th home, family, roots, parent Cancer Moon 5th creativity, children, romance, entertainment Leo Sun 6th health, service, work, routine Virgo Mercury 7th partners, marriage, open enemies Libra Venus 8th sex, death, inheritances, other’s money, loss Scorpio Pluto Mars 9th travel, higher education, religion, spirituality, law Sagittarius Jupiter 10th career, social position, dominant parent Capricorn Saturn 11th friendships, associations, aspirations Aquarius Uranus Saturn 12th hidden matters, the unconscious, clandestine relationships, secret enemies, seclusion Pisces Neptune Jupiter\\n\\nTake Note: The qualities of the zodiac signs are not exactly the same as those of the Houses which they are associated with. There are subtle differences between the qualities of the signs and Houses. More on the zodiac signs later; but first, learn about the star players, the Planets.

If you prefer, see Synastry Interpretations instead.)\\n\\nHouse Overlays say a great deal about how you see each other, what you expect out of each other, and in which areas of life you affect each other. The planets overlaid in the Houses of another person reveal how the planet person (person who’s planets are in your houses) perceives the house person (person who’s birthchart houses the other’s planets are overlayed upon). The planet person will then have expectations according to their perceptions of the house person. The planet person will act accordingly. This, in turn, evokes a response from the house person. Here begin the dynamics of the relationship. Then we flip the whole thing to see the 2nd person’s planets in the 1st person’s houses.\\n\\nHouse overlays are the secret to knowing how that special guy or girl really sees you. House overlays don’t necessarily describe how compatible you are based on your personalities. They reveal how you see each other. How we perceive each other largely determines how we treat each other, and whether or not we’ll even approach each other. Are they intimidated by you? Are they mesmerized? Are they disgusted?\\n\\nIn effect, House Overlays reveal the areas of life of the house person that will be affected by the other’s presence (planets). But it begins with the perception of the planet person. It’s similar to entering someone’s actual home. When you enter someone’s home for the first time, you immediately perceive and form expectations based on the surrounding environment. Similarly, the planet person enters a birth chart house, and perceives you according to the environment of that specific house.\\n\\nSince House Overlays reveal perceptions and expectations regarding the partner, they can be used to pinpoint problems. Many relationship problems, separations, and divorces come about because of wrong perceptions about the partner, or lofty expectations. Partners should discuss what the House Overlays reveal, as it would bring them to a common understanding about each other’s expectations.\\n\\nIn addition, House Overlays can reveal why certain relationships never get off the ground.

Planets making harmonious aspects mean that those dimensions represented by each planet blend together with pleasing results. Planets making inharmonious (often called challenging or dynamic) aspects produce discordant, irritating and unpleasant results.\\n\\nFor example, a man’s Moon blending harmoniously (conjunct) with a woman’s Venus will make for a tender, emotional, sweet interaction between them (if the rest of the synastric analysis concurs). On the other hand, if his Moon makes a challenging aspect (square) to her Venus, then her way of projecting herself as a woman (Venus) will emotionally (Moon) irritate him instead of arousing tenderness.\\n\\nNow, there is always a mixture of harmonious and challenging synastry aspects between two charts. Don’t expect to find perfect synastry. That probably does not exist. We are simply looking for the positive aspects to be stronger than the negative aspects. If the negative aspects are stronger than the positive, the two people will bug each other so much that the irritation will outweigh the power of attraction between them.\\n\\nRelated\\n\\nSynastry Interpretations\\n\\nLove & Relationship Articles\\n\\nCite This Page\\n\\nMLA style\\n\\nCorinne Lane. \"Synastry Aspects – Deeper into the 3 parts of Synastry\" Astrolibrary.

You should already know that aspects are relationships, measured in degrees of arc, between two planets in your birth chart. (An aspect can also take place between a planet and a special angle or point in your birth chart, i.e. Ascendant, M.C., I.C., Descendant, Lunar Nodes, and some other points.)\\n\\nTransits are, in effect, aspects between a planet’s current position up above and its position in your birth chart.\\n\\nThe positions of the planets at the moment you were born are captured on your birth chart. As you took your first breath, the planets continued on their tracks. As the planets continue moving, every once in a while, they come into aspect with the planetary positions on your birth chart.\\n\\nFor example, say you were born with the Sun at 16 ° and 28 minutes of Cancer, and Pluto at 24 ° of Libra. When Pluto moved into 16 degrees of Capricorn, in the year 2016, it made an opposition aspect (180 °) to your natal Sun.\\n\\nTo be clear, that aspect is called a “transit.” We would not call it an aspect because when we speak of aspects, we are usually speaking of natal aspects based on the positions of the planets at someone’s birth. An aspect made by a transiting planet is called a “transit” in astrology.\\n\\nA moving planet can stay in aspect anywhere from a few hours up to a few years. The moon, because she moves so fast, makes aspects only for a short hour or two. And then she’s gone. Neptune and Pluto, because they move so slowly (relative motion), can stay in aspect for 2 or 3 years. Use an orb of 1 degree to consider transits (but use a 2 degree orb to plan ahead!) While a moving planet is in aspect to a natal planetary position, the moving planet is said to be “transiting” the natal planet.\\n\\nThe transit has an influence over you during the entire time that it’s transiting, but it also has a point at which it becomes “exact.” This is the day when it reaches the exact degree, minute, and second of your birth planet. Some transits can become exact three times because of retrograde motion: the transiting planet passes over the point once, then the planet goes retrograde and backtracks over the point, then the planet goes back into direct motion and passes over the point a third time.\\n\\nIn the example above, Pluto would be transiting your natal Sun throughout most of 2016 because it will be close enough to 16 ° to be considered in aspect. But that transit becomes “exact” in 2016 when Pluto reaches exactly 10 ° and 28 minutes of Capricorn.\\n\\nIn summary, transits are simply aspects made by the current moving planets to our birth-chart planets. Technically, the planets are always in transit, as in “on the move.” But in astrology, “transit” is a term of art. In the language of astrology, planets make “transits” or are “transiting” only when they make aspects to our birth chart.\\n\\nTo find out your own personal transits, try the Transits calculator.\\n\\nCite This Page\\n\\nMLA style\\n\\nCorinne Lane. \"What Are Transits In Astrology? – Lesson 18\" Astrolibrary.

Aspects indicate how the various planetary and sign energies actually play out. They indicate, among other things, if there will be struggles or ease. Without acknowledging the aspects in a chart, the reading is incomplete, and ultimately incorrect. Keep this in mind when you begin to read the interpretations of your planets in the signs of your chart – the aspects tell more of the story.\\n\\nSo, what are aspects in astrology? Simply put, aspects are a connection or relationship between two or more planets. This connection always alters the interpretation of the planets and signs involved. When planets are in aspect to each other, their interpretations must be blended according to the nature of the aspect.\\n\\nTo be precise, aspects are special degrees of separation between the planets, with respect to the Earth. Since astrology focuses on the interplay between the celestial bodies and our Earth, we take a geocentric (Earth-centered) view of the heavens. The planets, then, are observed to orbit at different speeds in approximately the same plane in space.\\n\\nearth space astrology art\\n\\nAs a result of these planetary motions, various angles, measured in degrees, arc minutes, and arc seconds, are formed between the planets as seen from the Earth. In mathematics, an angle is defined as that fraction of a circle formed between two lines that intersect at the vertex. Imagine the Earth being at the center of the circle. Then imagine a line being drawn from two planets each to the Earth, so that the Earth is the vertex of the angle. The number of degrees between the two lines connecting two planets with respect to the Earth forms the angular relationship – the aspect – between the two planets. Aspects are considered not only for the planets, Sun, and Moon, but also for the points of the Ascendant and the Midheaven.\\n\\nExample of an Aspect\\n\\nastrology chart square aspect, labeled\\n\\nIn this example image, the Sun and the Moon are in \"square\" aspect. They are 90° apart, as you can see by the angle formed by the gray lines. However, astrologers do not label aspects like that, for that would be a tangled mess of lines in the birth chart. Instead, the angular relationships are denoted by a single line connecting the two planets in aspect. Thus, in any astrology chart, the square aspect will be denoted by a line like the red one in the image above.\\n\\nCertain degrees of angularity are very important in astrology. They are called the \"major aspects.\" The major aspects are 0° (conjunction), 60° (sextile), 90° (square), 120° (trine), and 180° (opposition).\\n\\nWhat Are Orbs?\\n\\nNow, aspects are given a margin in which they have an influence. For example, although the square aspect is 90°, two planets that are 95° (or 85°) apart are still considered to be in square aspect. This margin of influence is called an \"orb\" in astrology. In the example of 95°, it is considered a square aspect with an orb of 5°, since it deviates 5° from an exact square. An allowable orb is the amount by which the two planets involved can deviate from the exact number of degrees of the aspect and still be considered to have an aspect influence. Most astrologers use an allowable orb of only 6° for the major aspects, and 2° or 3° for the minor aspects. However, the allowable orb is increased to 10° (or 8°) if it includes the Sun or Moon. This is a matter of preference, but in fact, the smaller the orb, the more significant the aspect is, with orbs of less than 1° being the most potent aspect influences.\\n\\nAs you\\'ll see below, each aspect can be defined as a circle divided by a number. A full circle is 360°. However, to avoid confusion, notice that the astrology chart is divided into 12 signs of 30° each. Then the square aspect (90°) will be between planets that are in the same degree, but three signs apart. The sextile will be two signs apart, the trine will be four signs apart, and the opposition will be six signs apart.\\n\\nMany pages can be written describing the dynamics of each aspect, but here we will brief. Keep in mind that as you grow in your knowledge of astrology, and as you gain experience in interpreting charts, you can add your own insight into how the aspects are manifested.\\n\\nMajor Aspects\\n\\nConjunction ()\\n\\ndiagram of conjunction astrology aspect, 0 degrees\\n\\nThe conjunction (0°) is the circle divided by one (in which the conjunction can be termed as 360° apart, which is the same as 0° in a circle). This is a very dynamic aspect, since it marks a strong focalized potential for expression along with a tendency for direct action and self-dramatization. The two planets in conjunction are blended together, fused, and intensified. Planets in conjunction must be interpreted as a blend in which the planets work together. This can be a good thing if the two planets get along (like say, Venus and the Moon), but it can be inharmonious if the two planets are incompatible (like say, Mars and Neptune).\\n\\nSextile (\\n\\nsextile astrology aspect, glyph symbol\\n\\nDiagram of sextile astrology aspect\\n\\nThe sextile aspect (60°) is the circle divided by six. It represents an easy flow of opportunities or ideas that, if acted upon, will help realize the individual\\'s goals. It can also indicate talents. This is a harmonious aspect in which the energies of the planets involved collaborate well and work comfortably together. However, while this is traditionally a positive aspect, it is not dynamic. This aspect is rather passive, and it does not necessarily bring an impetus to do anything. The sextile aspect can be characterized as a lack of friction. The main reason that it’s considered positive is that it will not disrupt anything. This is usually pleasant, but can sometimes go unnoticed.\\n\\nSquare ()\\n\\nThe square (90°) is the circle divided by four. This aspect implies restrictions and challenges. It is a dynamic aspect since the challenges pressure you to work on the issues represented by the planets involved. Planets in square aspect are at cross-purposes. They are in conflict that leads to irritation; achievement is delayed, though patient hard work can lead to success through integration of the two principles. Traditionally, this is a negative, inharmonious aspect. The planets and houses involved are areas in the individual\\'s life where adjustments must be made and where tremendous effort must be expended to realize gains.\\n\\nTrine ()\\n\\ndiagram of trine astrology aspect\\n\\nThe trine (120°) is the circle divided by three. This is considered the most fortunate of aspects. The trine aspect represents easy flowing energy between the planets involved, bringing luck, opportunities, and innate creative talents. But even too much of a good thing can be bad – the ease brought on by the trine can sometimes be taken for granted, and the talents left unexpressed. In the ancient days, this aspect was thought to bring about a laziness (due to all the good luck) that was considered evil. But more often than not, the trine aspect tends to manifest the most pleasant potential of the planets involved.\\n\\nOpposition ()\\n\\nThe opposition (180°) is the circle divided by two. Planets in opposition will appear directly across from each other in the birth chart. This aspect indicates a fundamental polarity or duality; a situation in which one must cooperate with others or break with them. It creates tension leading to frustration, though objectivity can lead to a delicate balancing of opposites. Resolving the tension is helped by compromising between the two energies, otherwise they bounce back and forth, competing for center stage in your life. Compromise can be achieved by accepting that the two are parts of a whole. In general, this is considered an inharmonious aspect.\\n\\nMinor Aspects\\n\\nSemi-sextile (\\n\\nsemi-sextile astrology aspect glyph symbol\\n\\nThe semi-sextile (30°) is the circle divided by 12. This aspect is very mild, barely noticeable, almost insignificant. It is considered by some astrologers as mildly beneficial, but since it connects signs of different elements and qualities, it may actually be mildly difficult, awkward, or uncomfortable. This aspect should be interpreted by taking into account the rest of the chart for more insight. This minor aspect will usually corroborate with other things specified in the chart.\\n\\nSemi-square ()\\n\\nThe semi-square (45°) is the circle divided by 8. This is similar to the square, but less intense. This aspect implies friction, generating minor internal conflict or frustration that can be annoying.\\n\\nSesqui-quadrate (\\n\\nsesqui-square astrology aspect glyph symbol\\n\\nThe sesquiquadrate (135°), also known as the sesquisquare, is 3/8 of a circle, or \"a square and a half.\" This aspect denotes the same friction as the semi-square, but this irritation tends to generate external difficulties (whereas the semi-square correlates more with inner conflict).\\n\\nQuincunx (or Inconjunct) (\\n\\nquincunx astrology aspect\\n\\nThe quincunx (150°) is 5/12 of a circle. This aspect demands continual adjustments. It is not necessarily negative, but it brings strain, some difficulty, or stress. This can sometimes affect the health. It can indicate circumstances that are forced upon the person, or self-neglect regarding that area of life.\\n\\nQuintile ()\\n\\nThe quintile (72°) is the circle divided by five. Quintiles imply artistic or creative talents, especially mental ones, as well as versatility and an authentic individuality. It is considered mildly beneficial. The biquintile (144°, ) is considered in the same way as the quintile.\\n\\nThe Cosmolabe Was Used To Measure Aspects\\n\\nPeople in history measured the aspects using a cosmolabe. The following cosmolabe was made by Jacques Besson in 1567. He was a French mathematician, inventor, and philosopher.\\n\\nCosmolabe invented by Jacques Besson, circa 1567\\n\\nIf you made it this far, congratulations. There is still much, much more to learn in the field of astrology. We will continue to add lessons at regular intervals.\\n\\nWith what you\\'ve learned so far, you can begin to interpret your natal chart. You may want to begin with a chart of a close friend or relative, instead of yourself, since we have the tendency to use rose-colored lenses when inspecting ourselves. While rose-colored lenses have their place, they are not helpful when we are trying to take an accurate inventory of our strengths, weaknesses, drives, and potential.\\n\\nCite This Page\\n\\nMLA style\\n\\nCorinne Lane. \"Aspects and Orbs in Astrology – Lesson 9\" Astrolibrary.

Whereas Venus represents the female, Mars is all male. Whereas Venus is about harmony, Mars is conflict, aggression, and outright war. Mars is the planet of physical energy. It governs your sex drive, your forcefulness and your aggression. It is associated with your desires and aspirations for emotional, physical, mental and spiritual things that stimulate activity. You have to want something before you reach out and take it; Mars is the heated passion behind action. Mars shows your ability to turn ideas into action. The sign of Mars in your natal chart indicates your vitality, energy level, and style of action. In a female's chart, the Mars sign is one factor suggesting the type of man she attracts. In its highest form, Mars represent your unleashed energy and your human will – initiative. A controlled Mars can give a healthy dose of assertiveness and ambition. At its worst, Mars energy makes one prone to anger, harshness and destructive violence, impulsive behavior, danger, combativeness and every kind of cruelty.

See how the cusp of the 4th house is the I.C., the lowest point on the chart, representative of things below the surface of Earth. Due to that, the 4th house was believed to rule the conditions at the end of life, and graves. As the root or base of your real self, the 4th house rules where you go when you \"die\" but also where you came from. For those who believe in reincarnation, the 4th house would give clues to your karmic lesson for this lifetime. It shows what karmic baggage you brought with you into this life. Even if you don\\'t believe in reincarnation, you\\'re likely to be surprised by what you find in your 4th house for it may move your soul.\\n\\nAny planets in the 4th house affect your home life, your emotions, your subconscious, and possibly your relationship with your parents.\\n\\nTop\\n\\n5th Astrological House\\n\\nThe fifth House refers to children, creativity, and the pursuit of pleasure. This includes personal interests, love affairs, sports, hobbies, speculation, risk-taking, teaching, drama, creative self-expression, love given, gambling. The 5th house is all about you being yourself and enjoying it.\\n\\nRomance, dating, love affairs, and sexual relationships are ruled by this 5th house, yet marriage is assigned to the 7th. Why? Because, until very recently, marriage was not entered into for pleasure, for love, nor for personal fulfillment. Marriage was hardly even entered into by choice, but rather for the purpose of raising kids to preserve the values of a particular culture or religion. And these marriages were most often arranged according to class and financial status, a partnership befitting the 7th house.\\n\\nNowadays, it\\'s common to marry for love. To avoid confusion, remember: affairs of the heart are in the 5th house, but cooperative partnerships are in the domain of the 7th house.\\n\\nTop\\n\\n6th Astrological House'),\n",

This is not to say that the planets (or the signs) cause anything to happen. What we observe is synchrony – that things are taking place in sync. One movement is flowing throughout our space, heavens, and Earth. Instead of causing, the planets indicate things, describing what is already taking place. But for the sake of convenience, astrologers use phrases like, “your Venus makes you like this,” or “his Mars made him act like that.” Please note that this is only for convenience in communicating. Astrologers know that the planets don’t force us to do anything, any more than your 5:00pm clock forces you to stop working. But you do stop working when the clock strikes 5:00pm, don’t you? And so you pay careful attention to that clock, because that clock will show you when it’s time to go home from work. But the clock never forced you to leave work, neither did it ever seal your fate. In the end, you decide when to leave work. That is the beauty of synchronicity.'),\n",

Previously, we likened the signs to \"stained-glass windows\" through which the planet is expressed. See if this analogy helps: envision a sentence, with a \"verb\" and an \"adverb.\" The planet is the \"verb\" while the zodiac sign is the \"adverb.\" For example, the Moon (feel, nurture, respond) in the sign of Capricorn (reservedly, coldly) denotes someone who nurtures in a cold and reserved way, or has trouble expressing emotions. That\\'s not a happy placement for the Moon, but remember: there\\'s more to the story…the rest of the chart. (See what each planet means in Lesson 5: The Planets. See what each zodiac sign means in Lesson 8: Zodiac Signs)\\n\\nIncorporating the Astrological Houses\\n\\nThe other thing to remember is that the planet in the sign will focus on the House. This means that the activity denoted by the planet will take place in the arena of your life designated by the House in which that planet falls. (Remember, each House represents a sphere of life – i.e. work, home, friendships, etc.) The planet is the \"what,\" the sign is \"how\" that \"what\" is done, and the House is \"where\" it takes place. Here is a handy reminder to use when interpreting your natal chart:\\n\\nPlanets = What? Signs = How? Houses = Where?\\n\\nThe following table explains it further.\\n\\nPlanets = “What” = energies; what you like to do Signs = “How” = the way you do it Houses = “Where” = areas of your life\\n\\nAn example of why taking the House into consideration is so important:\\n\\nSay a person has Saturn in Capricorn in the 7th House, which could manifest as a reserved (Capricorn) attitude in love relationships (7th House). Then, say this same individual has Venus in Sagittarius in the 11th House. This person will be friendly and outgoing (Sagittarius) in social situations and groups (11th House), but unemotional and detached (although dependable) in love relationships (Saturn in Capricorn in the 7th). (Astrology is a powerful tool for understanding those seemingly contradicting tendencies that we all have. The birth chart tells it all. With time and patience, you will be able to read all such details from a birth chart)'),\n",

The ten planets of astrology are: Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto[1]. (From our geocentric position, Earth is not included in the list; however Earth\\'s interplay in the scheme of things is denoted by the Ascendant.) However, before the 18th century only the first seven planets were recognized (they were perceivable to the naked eye): Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Since over 2,000 years ago, the seven classical planets were observed to keep time, orbiting steadily on their paths. Perhaps that is why the number seven was symbolic of deity in ancient cultures. The seven were named after Greek gods because their influence was considered to be as such. Seven was the number of days chosen for a week, with each day borrowing its name from one of the classical planets. (The days making up our calendar month were determined based on one complete cycle through the 12 zodiac signs by the moon, from which the word \"month\" comes from.)\\n\\nThe discoveries of Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto corresponded to revolutionary changes in our world, from the Industrial Revolution and discovery of electricity (Uranus), to the financial collapse and interest in world domination of the 1930’s (Pluto). Pluto’s demotion of status to a “dwarf planet” does not change the fact that it is a celestial body participating in the continuous flow of energy in our world. Thus, Pluto is included here as a planet. (Astrology also observes several other asteroids/planetoids, regardless of planetary status. The body is there, thus, it counts.)\\n\\nEach planet symbolizes a different component of life, a different type of energy. In psychological terms, we can call them “needs” or “drives.” Click on the astrology planets above to learn what each one brings to astrology.\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n1.

Whereas Venus represents the female, Mars is all male. Whereas Venus is about harmony, Mars is conflict, aggression, and outright war. Mars is the planet of physical energy. It governs your sex drive, your forcefulness and your aggression. It is associated with your desires and aspirations for emotional, physical, mental and spiritual things that stimulate activity. You have to want something before you reach out and take it; Mars is the heated passion behind action. Mars shows your ability to turn ideas into action. The sign of Mars in your natal chart indicates your vitality, energy level, and style of action. In a female's chart, the Mars sign is one factor suggesting the type of man she attracts. In its highest form, Mars represent your unleashed energy and your human will – initiative. A controlled Mars can give a healthy dose of assertiveness and ambition. At its worst, Mars energy makes one prone to anger, harshness and destructive violence, impulsive behavior, danger, combativeness and every kind of cruelty. It’s up to you to use this force constructively.\\n\\nInterpretations for Mars in each zodiac sign are available here: Mars in the Signs.\\n\\nInterpretations for Mars in each House of the birth chart: Mars in Houses\\n\\nReturn to Top Return to Aries\\n\\njupiter astrology planet\\n\\nJupiter\\n\\n“I grow”\\n\\nBest quality: Benevolence (kindness) Worst quality: Conceit\"),\n",

See how the cusp of the 4th house is the I.C., the lowest point on the chart, representative of things below the surface of Earth. Due to that, the 4th house was believed to rule the conditions at the end of life, and graves. As the root or base of your real self, the 4th house rules where you go when you \"die\" but also where you came from. For those who believe in reincarnation, the 4th house would give clues to your karmic lesson for this lifetime. It shows what karmic baggage you brought with you into this life. Even if you don\\'t believe in reincarnation, you\\'re likely to be surprised by what you find in your 4th house for it may move your soul.\\n\\nAny planets in the 4th house affect your home life, your emotions, your subconscious, and possibly your relationship with your parents.\\n\\nTop\\n\\n5th Astrological House\\n\\nThe fifth House refers to children, creativity, and the pursuit of pleasure. This includes personal interests, love affairs, sports, hobbies, speculation, risk-taking, teaching, drama, creative self-expression, love given, gambling. The 5th house is all about you being yourself and enjoying it.\\n\\nRomance, dating, love affairs, and sexual relationships are ruled by this 5th house, yet marriage is assigned to the 7th. Why? Because, until very recently, marriage was not entered into for pleasure, for love, nor for personal fulfillment. Marriage was hardly even entered into by choice, but rather for the purpose of raising kids to preserve the values of a particular culture or religion. And these marriages were most often arranged according to class and financial status, a partnership befitting the 7th house.\\n\\nNowadays, it\\'s common to marry for love. To avoid confusion, remember: affairs of the heart are in the 5th house, but cooperative partnerships are in the domain of the 7th house.\\n\\nTop\\n\\n6th Astrological House'),\n",

Moon or Venus in the 4th house prefers to sit at home. Moon or Venus in the 7th house needs to be in a one-to-one relationship, but in the 11th house large community groups are preferred. Moon or Venus in the 12th is comfortable in solitude and may forego partnerships altogether. 10th or 6th house: needs to be productive instead of relaxing and thrill seeking; likely a workaholic. But in the 10th house, public worldly success is a must, while in the 6th enjoyment comes simply from a job well-done, working behind the scenes.\\n\\nExamine the Houses containing the Moon and Venus in both charts to see if the individuals can possibly enjoy life together.\\n\\nSee descriptions of all 12 Houses See interpretations for Moon in the Houses See interpretations for Venus in the Houses\\n\\nWhere are you Frustrated or Limited?\\n\\nLook at House of Saturn\\n\\nThe House containing Saturn is the most frustrating area of life for the individual. There exists ambivalence regarding this house: you want the stuff of this house, yet at the same time, you don't want it. There seems to be built-in limitations in this area of life. What is frustrating for the individual will eventually carry over into any relationship. Couples beware of your partner's house of Saturn! Limitations can be overcome, but not without struggle, as this house is sure to teach. Can you accept your partner’s Saturn? More about Saturn in the Houses.\\n\\nWhere are you Disappointed?

To avoid confusion, remember: affairs of the heart are in the 5th house, but cooperative partnerships are in the domain of the 7th house.\\n\\nTop\\n\\n6th Astrological House\\n\\nThe sixth House refers to daily work, service, diet, health and physical sickness, physical ability to work, employees. This includes volunteer labor, civil service work, caretaking, and mundane daily tasks. The 6th house really involves the quality of your work, the quality of the jobs you perform, as opposed to an actual career (career is represented by the 10th house). Daily mundane tasks include personal hygiene and our method of responding to everyday crises.\\n\\nTop\\n\\n7th Astrological House\\n\\nThe seventh House is sometimes referred to as the House of marriage, but it encompasses all one-to-one relationships: marriage, business partnerships, contracts, cooperative relationships, and also divorce, separation, quarrels, open enemies, and law suits.\\n\\nThe difference between the love affairs of the 5th House and love relationships of the 7th is that the 7th House refers to more permanently binding relationships, whereas the 5th House refers to affairs that may be temporary. When the 5th House affair progresses into a serious relationship, we can say that the relationship has \"moved into the 7th House.\"\\n\\n7th house relationships are about cooperation and sharing, and they generally serve some functional purpose in the larger social community (i.e. a marriage). This is different from a 5th house love affair, whose only qualification is \"butterflies in the stomach.\"\\n\\nThe 7th house includes the way you relate to those closest to you. Planets in this house will influence your manner of relating. They also give clues to issues that arise in your relationships.\\n\\nTop\\n\\n8th Astrological House\\n\\nSimply put, the 8th house is the polar opposite of the 2nd house. Whereas the 2nd rules your own individual possessions, the 8th house rules what a relationship owns (joint finances).'),\n",

Previously, we likened the signs to \"stained-glass windows\" through which the planet is expressed. See if this analogy helps: envision a sentence, with a \"verb\" and an \"adverb.\" The planet is the \"verb\" while the zodiac sign is the \"adverb.\" For example, the Moon (feel, nurture, respond) in the sign of Capricorn (reservedly, coldly) denotes someone who nurtures in a cold and reserved way, or has trouble expressing emotions. That\\'s not a happy placement for the Moon, but remember: there\\'s more to the story…the rest of the chart. (See what each planet means in Lesson 5: The Planets. See what each zodiac sign means in Lesson 8: Zodiac Signs)\\n\\nIncorporating the Astrological Houses\\n\\nThe other thing to remember is that the planet in the sign will focus on the House. This means that the activity denoted by the planet will take place in the arena of your life designated by the House in which that planet falls. (Remember, each House represents a sphere of life – i.e. work, home, friendships, etc.) The planet is the \"what,\" the sign is \"how\" that \"what\" is done, and the House is \"where\" it takes place. Here is a handy reminder to use when interpreting your natal chart:\\n\\nPlanets = What? Signs = How? Houses = Where?\\n\\nThe following table explains it further.\\n\\nPlanets = “What” = energies; what you like to do Signs = “How” = the way you do it Houses = “Where” = areas of your life\\n\\nAn example of why taking the House into consideration is so important:\\n\\nSay a person has Saturn in Capricorn in the 7th House, which could manifest as a reserved (Capricorn) attitude in love relationships (7th House). Then, say this same individual has Venus in Sagittarius in the 11th House. This person will be friendly and outgoing (Sagittarius) in social situations and groups (11th House), but unemotional and detached (although dependable) in love relationships (Saturn in Capricorn in the 7th). (Astrology is a powerful tool for understanding those seemingly contradicting tendencies that we all have. The birth chart tells it all. With time and patience, you will be able to read all such details from a birth chart)')],\n",
       " 'response': 'Certainly! Here\\'s a detailed interpretation of **Mars in the 5th House** based on the astrological context provided:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Mars in the 5th House: Meaning and Interpretation\\n\\n**Mars = \"I act\"**  \\nMars represents initiative, physical energy, drive, passion, and assertiveness. It symbolizes your ability to take decisive action, express desire, and pursue what excites you.\\n\\n**5th House = Creativity, Pleasure, Romance, and Self-Expression**  \\nThe 5th House governs children, creative endeavors, love affairs, romance, personal hobbies, risk-taking, sports, and the general enjoyment of life. It is where you \"be yourself and enjoy it.\" Love affairs here are passionate but often temporary or exploratory rather than long-term commitments.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### What Mars in the 5th House Indicates\\n\\n1. **Energetic and Passionate Pursuit of Pleasure**  \\nMars here infuses your romantic and creative life with high energy and enthusiasm. You tend to pursue love affairs and hobbies with a lot of passion and assertiveness. You don’t shy away from taking risks in love or creative projects — your approach is direct and sometimes competitive.\\n\\n2. **Dynamic and Competitive in Romance and Play**  \\nYou may have a strong sexual drive and express your desires boldly in romantic or playful situations. Mars adds a fiery, active quality to your dating life, making you more likely to seek excitement and adventure in love affairs rather than passive or slow-moving relationships.\\n\\n3. **Strong Drive for Creative Self-Expression**  \\nIn creative pursuits, Mars gives you the initiative and courage to start new projects, perform, or engage in sports or games with vigor. You like to be physically and mentally engaged in activities that allow you to shine and take center stage.\\n\\n4. **Potential for Impulsiveness and Conflict**  \\nWhile Mars energizes pleasure and creativity, it can also bring impulsiveness or aggression. You might be quick to jump into romantic liaisons or competitive activities, sometimes leading to conflicts or heated situations. Managing this energy constructively is key.\\n\\n5. **Love Affairs as a Field of Action**  \\nSince the 5th House rules love affairs (not marriage), Mars here suggests that your romantic relationships might be exciting but possibly short-lived or experimental. The \"heated passion behind action\" Mars brings means you likely feel butterflies intensely and act on them quickly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Synthesis: How Mars Expresses in the 5th House\\n\\n- **You thrive on excitement and action in romance, creativity, and leisure.**  \\n- **You may be assertive or even aggressive in love affairs, often taking the lead or initiating relationships.**  \\n- **Creative and physical outlets (sports, drama, hobbies) will be important ways you channel your Mars energy.**  \\n- **Watch out for impulsiveness or harshness in romantic or playful contexts; learning to control Mars\\' intensity will enhance enjoyment.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Additional Notes\\n\\n- The **sign Mars is in** would further color how this energy manifests (e.g., Mars in Aries in the 5th will be especially fiery and direct; Mars in Pisces in the 5th might express passion more subtly or artistically).  \\n- The **aspects Mars makes to other planets** can amplify or temper this energy, but since those details aren’t provided, this is a general interpretation.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIf you want insights about specific signs or aspects of Mars in the 5th House, or how current transits might activate this placement, feel free to ask!\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\nMars in the 5th House energizes your love affairs, creative self-expression, and pursuit of pleasure. You act with passion and initiative in these areas, often seeking excitement and challenge. This placement encourages you to be bold in romance and creativity but cautions against impulsiveness and conflict.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI hope this helps you understand the dynamic influence of Mars placed in the 5th House of a natal chart!'}"

    "1. **Context Recall** (Baseline: 95.83% vs Finetuned: 77.05%)\n",
    "   - The baseline model is significantly better at retrieving relevant context\n",
    "   - This suggests the finetuning process may have made the model more selective or less comprehensive in its context retrieval\n",
    "   - Example: In the \"Henley\" question, the baseline model better captured the full context about free will vs fate\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Faithfulness** (Finetuned: 74.52% vs Baseline: 71.47%)\n",
    "   - The finetuned model performs slightly better here\n",
    "   - This suggests it's better at staying true to the source content\n",
    "   - However, the improvement is marginal\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Factual Correctness** (Baseline: 60.91% vs Finetuned: 55.64%)\n",
    "   - The baseline model is more accurate in its factual responses\n",
    "   - The finetuned model shows more errors in factual information\n",
    "   - Example: In the \"2nd House\" question, the baseline model provided more accurate astrological interpretations\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Answer Relevancy** (Baseline: 94.84% vs Finetuned: 86.69%)\n",
    "   - The baseline model's answers are more relevant to the questions\n",
    "   - The finetuned model sometimes goes off-topic or provides less focused responses\n",
    "   - Example: In the \"Neptune\" question, the baseline model stayed more focused on the specific aspect being asked about\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Context Entity Recall** (Baseline: 59.28% vs Finetuned: 53.15%)\n",
    "   - The baseline model is better at recalling specific entities from the context\n",
    "   - The finetuned model misses some key entities or concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Noise Sensitivity** (Baseline: 27.07% vs Finetuned: 24.61%)\n",
    "   - Both models show relatively low noise sensitivity\n",
    "   - The baseline model is slightly more sensitive to noise\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential Reasons for Worse Performance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Overfitting**: The finetuned model may have overfit to specific patterns in the training data, making it less generalizable\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loss of General Knowledge**: The finetuning process might have caused the model to lose some of its general knowledge or ability to retrieve broad context\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Narrow Focus**: The finetuning may have made the model too specialized, causing it to miss important context or entities\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Training Data Quality**: The quality or size of the finetuning dataset might not have been optimal\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Review Finetuning Data**:\n",
    "   - Ensure the training data is diverse and high-quality\n",
    "   - Include more examples of different types of astrological questions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Adjust Finetuning Parameters**:\n",
    "   - Try different learning rates\n",
    "   - Experiment with different numbers of training epochs\n",
    "   - Consider using a smaller model as the base\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Balance Specialization**:\n",
    "   - Ensure the finetuning process maintains a balance between specialization and general knowledge\n",
    "   - Consider using techniques like LoRA or QLoRA to preserve more of the base model's capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluation Metrics**:\n",
    "   - Add more specific evaluation metrics for astrological accuracy\n",
    "   - Consider using human evaluation for complex astrological interpretations\n"
