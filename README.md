# AIE6JIA-Midterm

Welcome to the **AIE6JIA-Midterm** repository!

## Overview

This is a midterm project that demonstrates:
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- AI Agents / Function-calling capabilities
- Finetuning embeddings and evaluation with RAGAS

**Project Theme:**  
*Fortunetelling in the Age of AI*  
The project explores how modern AI techniques can be leveraged to build intelligent, interactive systems that simulate fortunetelling experiences, using advanced information retrieval, agent orchestration, and embedding finetuning.

## Features

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline
- AI Agent orchestration with function-calling
- Embedding finetuning for improved semantic understanding
- Evaluation of RAG systems using RAGAS
- Fun and creative fortunetelling scenarios powered by AI

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook
- (List any additional requirements, e.g., specific libraries, API keys)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Keatnuxsuo/AIE6JIA-Midterm.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd AIE6JIA-Midterm
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if a `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` is present):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

### Usage

- Open Jupyter Notebook:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```
- Run the main notebook(s) to explore fortunetelling with AI and the RAG pipeline.

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating each capability.
- `src/`: Core source code for RAG, agents, and evaluation.
- `data/`: (If present) Example datasets.
- `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`: Dependency list.

## Evaluation

RAG and AI agent capabilities are evaluated using RAGAS for benchmarking and analysis.
